40455216,2025,"BACKGROUND: In vitro, meropenem is shown to restore the activity of rifampicin in rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. This phase 2a trial aimed to determine if addition of rifampicin increases the early bactericidal activity (EBA) of meropenem plus amoxicillin/clavulanate in patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB). METHODS: Individuals with RR-TB were randomized to either 2 g meropenem infusion thrice daily plus amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg/125 mg orally thrice daily with 20 mg/kg rifampicin orally once daily (M-AC-R arm) or the same treatment without rifampicin (M-AC). Sputum samples were collected at baseline and throughout the 14-day treatment. Colony forming unit (CFU) and time-to-positivity (TTP) data were analysed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Plasma samples at day 13 were used to derive rifampicin and meropenem pharmacokinetic parameters using non-compartmental analysis. Rifampicin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined from baseline sputum isolates with and without meropenem. RESULTS: Of the 52 participants enrolled, 38 participants completed the trial. The majority (67%) were male, and the median age was 37 years. The median (95% prediction interval) predicted 14-day EBA in CFU was 1.33 (-0.15-3.64) and 1.20 (0.05-2.66) log10CFU/mL, and TTP increased by 0.220 (0.098-0.551) and 0.216 (0.126-0.505) log10h for the M-AC-R and M-AC arms, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the two arms. Meropenem pharmacokinetics were similar in both arms, and rifampicin MICs were not meaningfully reduced by meropenem. CONCLUSION: Adding rifampicin to meropenem plus amoxicillin/clavulanate did not enhance short-term antibacterial activity in patients with RR-TB.","[('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tuberculosis', 'DISEASE'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis', 'DISEASE'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('mg/125', 'CHEMICAL'), ('mg/kg rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('time-to-positivity', 'DISEASE'), ('TTP', 'DISEASE'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('log10CFU/mL', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TTP', 'DISEASE'), ('Meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40454567,2025,"The pharmacokinetics and plasma protein binding of amoxicillin in cats has not been thoroughly investigated. In a single-group sequential designed experimental study, amoxicillin was administered to six healthy cats intravenously, orally, and subcutaneously. Repeated blood samples were drawn after each administration, and amoxicillin concentrations were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry. Plasma amoxicillin data were subjected to population pharmacokinetic analysis, and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated. The population clearance was 0.18 L/h∙kg, the volume of the central compartment was 0.12 L/kg, the highly perfused compartment was 0.009 L/kg, and the poorly perfused compartment was 0.002 L/kg. The bioavailability was 33% and 69% after oral and subcutaneous administration, respectively. After subcutaneous administration of a slow-release formulation, there was absorption rate-limited pharmacokinetics. The plasma protein binding was 0%-24%. The results increase the understanding of the amoxicillin pharmacokinetics in cats. Further studies combining the results with pharmacodynamic data and in silico simulations are warranted.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40453930,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Eggs represent a vital dietary source globally; however, bacterial contamination poses a substantial public health risk. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the global prevalence of bacterial contamination in table eggs and to characterize the antibiotic resistance profiles of these pathogens, emphasizing their implications for public health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive bibliographic search of Web of Science, MEDLINE (PubMed), CAB Abstract, and Google Scholar databases was performed, identifying 136 studies published between 1979 and 2022. The systematic review utilized Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and advanced bibliometric techniques for data collection. Microsoft Excel and R software (v5.0) were employed for data consolidation and statistical analysis. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Higgins' I(2) index, and a random-effects model was adopted for prevalence estimation and subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Seventeen bacterial species were identified in eggs, primarily Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter spp., and Listeria monocytogenes. Overall, eggshell contamination rates exceeded those of egg contents. Salmonella spp. isolates exhibited complete resistance (100%) to nitrofurantoin, novobiocin, and polymyxin and substantial resistance (>50%) to commonly used antibiotics such as amoxicillin (74.5%), penicillin G (89.1%), and colistin (83.1%). E. coli isolates showed total resistance to penicillin G (100%) and high resistance to amoxicillin (72.2%) and ceftazidime (95.6%). Antibiotic resistance varied significantly across regions, notably higher in Asian and African isolates. Multidrug-resistant strains of E. coli and Campylobacter spp. were also identified. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the high global prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in poultry eggs and highlights concerning antibiotic resistance trends, particularly among Salmonella spp. and E. coli. The findings emphasize the urgent need for region-specific biosecurity protocols and antimicrobial stewardship strategies to reduce egg contamination and control antibiotic-resistant pathogens, ultimately safeguarding public health and food safety.","[('Listeria', 'DISEASE'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('novobiocin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polymyxin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colistin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin G', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40453927,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in livestock farming has contributed to the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, posing a significant public health challenge. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of Salmonella spp. isolated from swine and poultry in small- and medium-scale farms in Cambodia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 638 fecal samples (273 rectal swabs from swine and 365 cloacal swabs from poultry) were collected from five provinces in Cambodia from June to September 2021. Salmonella spp. isolation followed ISO 6579:2002 guidelines, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using the disk diffusion method, adhering to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2020 standards. Resistance was assessed against nine antimicrobial agents across five major classes. RESULTS: Overall, Salmonella was detected in 6.58% (42/638) of samples, with 6.96% (19/273) from swine and 6.30% (23/365) from poultry. Swine-derived isolates exhibited the highest prevalence in the growing stage (13.93%), whereas poultry isolates were most common in avian broilers (14.55%). High resistance was observed against beta-lactams (penicillin, amoxicillin, and ampicillin), tetracyclines, and sulfonamides, with resistance rates ranging from 73.81% to 100%. Fluoroquinolone resistance (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin) was moderate (29.77%), while aminoglycoside resistance (gentamicin) was low (2.38%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) patterns were identified in 91.30% (21/23) of poultry isolates and 52.63% (10/19) of swine isolates, with resistance spanning three to five antimicrobial classes. CONCLUSION: The presence of Salmonella in Cambodian swine and poultry farms and its high level of MDR underscore the urgent need for improved antimicrobial stewardship. The study highlights the risk of MDR Salmonella transmission through livestock production chains, emphasizing the necessity for stringent regulatory interventions, biosecurity measures, and surveillance programs to mitigate AMR spread in animal agriculture and public health sectors.","[('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ISO', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracyclines', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfonamides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Fluoroquinolone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycoside', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40453868,2025,"BACKGROUND: In addition to high palatability, meat and meat products are important sources of essential nutrients that are important to the growth and performance of our bodies. However, meat and its products can harbor various microorganisms. Pseudomonas species (spp.) are considered to be one of the primary causes of meat deterioration and spoilage, as well as foodborne illnesses. AIM: Different types of meat products were evaluated bacteriologically to detect the prevalence of Pseudomonas spp., in addition to the evaluation of the antibacterial effect of clove essential oil (CEO) on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: One hundred samples of minced meat, imported frozen meat, hamburgers, and luncheons were gathered randomly from various markets within the Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. Pseudomonas spp. were counted and identified; furthermore, the disk diffusion method was used to assess the antibiogram of P. aeruginosa, and some antibiotic resistance genes were detected. In addition, minimum inhibitory concentrations, minimum bactericidal concentrations, and the disc diffusion technique were used to evaluate the antibacterial properties of CEO in vitro. Furthermore, the experimental section assessed the effects of 5% and 10% CEO on the sensory characteristics and P. aeruginosa counts. RESULTS: The results showed that 44% of samples harbored Pseudomonas spp. with a mean count of 5.08 +/- 0.13, 4.43 +/- 0.25, 3.79 +/- 0.18, and 3.29 +/- 0.28 log(10) CFU/g in minced beef meat, imported frozen meat, hamburgers and luncheons, respectively. Four species were identified: P. psychrophila (40.9%), P. fluorescens (29.5%), P. fragi (18.2%), and P. aeruginosa (11.4%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100% resistant to tetracycline, oxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, lincomycin, and clindamycin; meanwhile, it was 100% sensitive to amikacin and ciprofloxacin. All tested P. aeruginosa harbored the blaSHV and Mcr1 genes; meanwhile, the blaOXA-1 gene was not detected. Furthermore, the CEO improved the sensory characteristics and reduced the number of P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Due to growing concerns about food safety, natural antimicrobials were applied to control multidrug-resistant foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria. CEO had a noticeable effect on the overall acceptability of meat by sensory evaluation, and it was highly effective in meat preservation, achieving a reduction percent in P. aeruginosa count by 99.6%.","[('clove', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('P. aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('P. aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('P.', 'DISEASE'), ('P.', 'DISEASE'), ('P. aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('lincomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amikacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('P. aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('P. aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('P. aeruginosa', 'DISEASE')]"
40451458,2025,"We present a rare case of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans bacteraemia and associated liver abscess. A 72-year-old Caucasian woman presented with an acute history of fevers, rigors and abdominal pain. She was managed empirically with ceftriaxone and metronidazole and required 24 hours of inotropic support due to hypotension from sepsis. A computed tomography scan of her abdomen demonstrated a 6cm liver abscess in maximal diameter. On day seven of her admission, blood cultures flagged an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus, which was later identified by MALDI-TOF MS as Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. The isolate was susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ertapenem, moxifloxacin, clindamycin and metronidazole but resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam. Despite percutaneous drainage on day two of admission, her fevers persisted for three weeks. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole were changed to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on day nine of admission, administered for a total of 6 weeks.

40450937,2025,"The continuous growth of global population has promoted the development of new aquaculture techniques for enhancing food supply. Modern approaches, such as Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), present new challenges concerning the elimination of chemical substances and pathogens that appear because of their operation. In this study, the simultaneous removal of amoxicillin and water disinfection was evaluated using different UV-C photoassisted Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs). The processes involved oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, sodium hypochlorite, potassium peroxymonosulfate, and sodium persulfate. The optimization of radiation and oxidant dosage was assessed in a batch system photoreactor using simulated aquaculture water. Moreover, the disinfection potential of these treatments, as well of the production of disinfection by-products (DBPs), phytotoxicity generation and matrix interaction are also addressed. Finally, a first approximation to the reaction mechanism is carried out via scavenging studies. Results show that 10 W/m(2) of UV-C and optimized dosages in the 0.1-3.2 mM range of oxidant eliminate at least 80 % of amoxicillin in 2 h of operation. Disinfection was achieved in 1 min of treatment and maintained for at least two weeks after storage. While DBPs and matrix parameters variation were minimal. Scavenging study shows that HO(⦁), (1)O(2), and SO(4)(⦁-) radicals are the main ones involved in antibiotic degradation. The optimization of operation conditions sets the path towards scale-up of the process in continuous systems, with the objective of application of the process in real aquaculture water.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('UV-C', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hydrogen', 'CHEMICAL'), ('peracetic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sodium hypochlorite', 'CHEMICAL'), ('potassium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sodium persulfate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('by-products', 'CHEMICAL'), ('UV-C', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40450742,2025,"STUDY AIMS:  Streptococcus agalacticae is a pathogen associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The current gold standard for preventing neonatal sepsis is the intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) of Streptococcus agalacticae-positive mothers. Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise and increasingly threatens public health. Therefore, the responsible use of antibiotics is critical. Switzerland lacks unified IAP guidelines. IAP management varies by obstetric ward and is based on various national and international guidelines. This study aimed to gain an overview of the variability of existing internal protocols for IAP for Streptococcus agalacticae in Swiss obstetrics wards. METHOD: In March and April 2024, all identified obstetric wards in Switzerland were contacted and invited to submit their internal protocols so that they could be analysed for the choice of antibiotics for IAP, the referenced literature supporting their protocols and the professions involved in their development. RESULTS: Of 87 departments contacted, 43 (49%) shared their protocols. Three beta-lactam antibiotics were identified as the first choice: penicillin G (56%, n = 24), amoxicillin (28%, n = 12) and co-amoxicillin (9%, n = 4). In 19% of the protocols (n = 8), there was no distinction between mild or severe allergy to penicillin derivatives. In this group (n = 8), 75% (n = 6) administered clindamycin as the second choice, with 50% (n = 3 of 6) offering vancomycin as an alternative in cases of known clindamycin resistance or allergy. In the group with allergy severity classification (n = 35), first- and second-generation cephalosporins were preferred for mild penicillin allergy: 71% (n = 25) used cefazolin, 26% (n = 9) used cefuroxime and erythromycin was mentioned by n = 1. In 21 of the 33 received protocols with references, Expert Letter No. 19 from the Swiss Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (SGGG) was referenced, making up 64 % of the used literature. This was followed by other literature (58 %, n = 19) and the revised guidelines of the Swiss Society of Neonatology in collaboration with the Paediatric Infectious Disease Group Switzerland (PIGS) (30 %, n = 10). Mostly gynaecologists (90%; n = 28 of 31) were involved as authors of internal protocols. Neonatologists were not mentioned by any. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that the management of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is heterogeneous, and antimicrobial stewardship is lacking in most Swiss obstetric wards. In terms of literature, German-speaking wards in Switzerland are more orientated towards German-speaking neighbouring countries than French- and Italian-speaking wards. There is a need to enhance interdisciplinarity in the development of internal protocols and to create a joint national guideline among professional societies.","[('sepsis', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('allergy', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('allergy', 'DISEASE'), ('allergy', 'DISEASE'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefazolin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40450674,2025,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a versatile pathogen that causes diseases. Raw milk is an ideal, rich medium that helps and supports the growth of microorganisms and is highly susceptible to S. aureus immediately after milking. As camel milk was usually consumed in its raw state in pastoralist areas, the contamination and intoxication of raw milk due to pathogenic S. aureus were a public health problem. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine the prevalence, antibiotic resistance pattern, and associated factors of S. aureus in raw camel milk in Babile District, Oromia Region, Eastern Ethiopia. METHOD: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Babille district among 350 raw camel milk. Participants were selected using a multi-stage sampling technique. Data was collected using a pretested structured questionnaire, and 25 mL of raw camel milk was collected in sterile screw-capped bottles. S. aureus was identified through culture, Gram stain, and biochemical tests. A bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was done. p-value </= 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULT: In this study, the overall prevalence of S. aureus in raw camel milk was 14% (95% CI: 10, 18). Parity [AOR = 3.52, 95% CI: (1.207, 10.277), p = 0.021], drainage condition of the milking place [AOR = 4.62, 95% CI: (1.853, 11.557), p = 0.001], not hand washing before milking [AOR = 3.94, 95% CI: (1.599, 9.716), p = 0.003] and the type of containers used for selling milk [AOR = 8.40, 95% CI: (1.258, 26.068), p = 0.028] were significant predictors of S. aureus. A high level of resistance was recorded against tetracycline (81.6%), penicillin G (81.6%), and amoxicillin (69.4%). CONCLUSION: Overall, the prevalence of S. aureus isolated from raw camel milk of the Babile district was high. Multi-drug resistance among the isolates was also high. Therefore, washing hands and milking containers before milking and using stainless steel containers instead of plastic containers could be applied. Raw camel milk intended for human consumption should be properly transported, stored and subjected to heat treatment. Increasing awareness and creation of the hygienic practice of camel milk handling is paramount. Antibiotics should only be used to treat sick animals based on the diagnosis of the diseases (Supplementary Information).","[('S. aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('S. aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('S. aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40447792,2025,"Bacterial biofilms on dental implants can lead to peri-implant infections and demonstrate a remarkable ability to evade host immunity and resist antibiotics. Advanced in vitro models, such as the three-dimensional implant-tissue-oral-bacterial-biofilm model (INTER(b)ACT), are essential to evaluate antibiofilm efficacy. The INTER(b)ACT model, effectively reproduces the complex triangular interactions between an organotypic oral mucosa, an integrated implant and an oral multispecies biofilms, in the peri-implant situation. Here, we investigated the effect of antibacterial agents (chlorhexidine, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and metronidazole) on biofilm-tissue interactions in the INTER(b)ACT model. While the antibacterial interventions had no effect on biofilm volume, all agents decreased the proportion of viable bacteria, underscoring their effect on bacterial viability despite biofilm resilience. Biofilm exposure to untreated tissues caused epithelial damage, whereas all antibacterial agents preserved epithelial integrity. However, the modulation of pro-inflammatory response differed between the various agents. All antibacterial treatments reduced hBD-2 and TIMP-1 levels. While doxycycline decreased IL-1beta and CCL20, chlorhexidine lowered TNF-alpha level. In conclusion, the INTER(b)ACT model allowed the successful assessment of antibacterial efficacy, elucidation of biofilm resistance and characterization of inflammation during peri-implant tissue-biofilm interactions. This validation highlights the model's potential as a platform for developing and evaluating new therapeutic strategies for peri-implant diseases.","[('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('chlorhexidine, amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chlorhexidine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TNF-alpha', 'CHEMICAL'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE')]"
40447047,2025,"BACKGROUND: Morbilliform drug eruptions (MDEs) and delayed-appearing urticaria are the most frequently reported nonimmediate reactions (NIRs) to penicillins. Direct challenges have recently been suggested in adults reporting distant MDEs or isolated urticaria. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of patch tests (PTs), intradermal tests (IDTs), challenges, and relevant reagents in evaluating NIRs to penicillins, and to determine the predictive value of their morphology and duration for a positive allergy test. METHODS: All patients over 15 years of age evaluated in 5 European centers between 2001 and 2022 with well-characterized NIRs to penicillins were included. Patients were evaluated with skin tests (PTs and/or delayed-reading IDTs) and, when skin test results were negative, drug challenges. RESULTS: We evaluated 872 patients: 583 reported MDEs, 193 urticarial/angioedematous reactions, 73 erythemas, and 23 other reactions; 647 patients underwent PTs and/or IDTs with benzylpenicillin reagents, amoxicillin, and suspected penicillins, while 225 only with the last and amoxicillin. PTs and/or delayed-reading IDTs (dIDTs) were positive in 291 patients (33.4%) and challenges in 26 (3%). In 583 patients with MDEs, the rate of positive dIDTs increased in accordance with the duration from 10.9% of 221 patients with eruptions lasting 2-4 days to 82.7% of 52 patients with MDEs lasting > 28 days. No patient tested negative for suspected penicillins and positive for other reagents. CONCLUSIONS: IDTs appear particularly useful in patients with well-characterized MDEs lasting > 4 days. Direct challenges are advisable in patients reporting urticarial and/or angioedematous reactions lasting > 1 day or other cutaneous reactions lasting </= 4 days, even well-characterized MDEs.

40445841,2025,"Fatty acids have antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria. We therefore aimed to incorporate omega-3 unsaturated alpha-linolenic acid (alphaLA) into the membrane of antibiotic-loaded liposomes to create a system with dual antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori. Liposomes containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol, sphingomyelin and the far-red fluorescent DiD label, with varying content of alphaLA (mol% to total lipid), were fabricated using the thin film evaporation method and hydrated with PBS or amoxicillin solution. The liposomes were characterized for alphaLA and amoxicillin content, particle size, membrane fluidity and permeability, prior to their addition to cultures of H. pylori strains and clinical isolates. alphaLA-modified liposomes enhanced the antibacterial action of amoxicillin against H. pylori, as determined using a viable count method. The liposomal formulation achieved a 3-log reduction in bacterial density, compared to a 1.5- to 2-log reduction by amoxicillin in solution. The application of imaging cytometry revealed a significantly increased association of alphaLA-modified liposomes with H. pylori cells, compared to non-alphaLA control liposomes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated, for the first time, that the incorporation of alphaLA increased the attraction of the liposomes to H. pylori and increased antibiotic potency.

This study compared the subgingival prevalence and levels of S. noxia in those with severe periodontitis and those with periodontal health and assessed the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of the species. Methods Subgingival biofilm samples from 206 adults with stage III (severe) periodontitis and 48 adults with periodontal health were examined with an S. noxia-specific whole chromosomal nucleic acid probe. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of six antibiotics against S. noxia were determined in vitro with antibiotic gradient strips. Results Selenomonas noxia was more frequently detected in patients with severe periodontitis (53.4%) than persons with periodontal health (20.8%) (2.6-fold more frequent, p = 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). Heavy subgingival colonization by S. noxia (>/=10(6) cells/subject subgingival specimen) was also more frequent in persons with severe periodontitis (16.0%) than those with periodontal health (2.1%) (7.6-fold more frequent, p = 0.008, Fisher's exact test). Selenomonas noxia was susceptible in vitro to amoxicillin, azithromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, and metronidazole (all MIC values </= 0.75 mg/L) but resistant to spiramycin (MIC > 32 mg/L). Conclusions Selenomonas noxia was significantly more prevalent at significantly higher subgingival levels in patients with severe periodontitis than adults with periodontal health. However, heavy S. noxia subgingival colonization was present in only a subset of severe periodontitis patients and rarely in those with periodontal health. Selenomonas noxia was susceptible in vitro to several antibiotics of potential therapeutic use in periodontitis therapy, with the exception of spiramycin.

The levels of IL-8 and TLR4 in CSOM group were higher than those in the control group, and gradually increased with the increase of hearing impairment. （P<0.05）. Elevated levels of IL-8, TLR4 were independent risk factors for the occurrence of CSOM（P<0.05）. The AUC of CSOM diagnosed by IL-8 and TLR4 alone was 0.790 and 0.777, respectively, while the AUC of combined diagnosis was 0.898, which was better than their respective individual diagnoses（both P<0.05）. Conclusion:The distribution of pathogenic bacteria in the ear canal secretions of CSOM patients is mainly Gram positive, with common ones being Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The levels of IL-8 and TLR4 in CSOM patients are higher than those in the control group. The higher the levels, the higher the degree of hearing loss, which can be used for clinical diagnosis.","[('chronic suppurative otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('Staphylococcus aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('Staphylococcus epidermidis', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ketoconazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluconazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('hearing impairment', 'DISEASE'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('hearing loss', 'DISEASE')]"
40442910,2025,"BACKGROUND: New antibacterial agents are urgently needed as bacterial diseases, especially urinary tract infections (UTIs), are becoming more common, and antibiotic resistance is increasing. AIMS: This study aimed to design, synthesize, and conduct molecular docking and biological evaluation of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-diones as antibacterial agents. METHODS: 7-Phenyl-5-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-diones were designed using an in silico approach. The designed compounds were synthesized using reported procedures. Molecular docking studies were carried out using the Maestro 12.9 module of Schrodinger software. QikProp module of the Schrodinger suite was used for in silico ADME evaluation of synthesized compounds. In vitro antibacterial activity of these compounds was assessed using the serial dilution method. RESULTS: Compounds MA-03 and MA-12 showed potent antibacterial activity with MIC values of 1.56, 3.125, 1.56, and 6.25 mug/ml and 1.56, 3.12, 6.25, and 3.12 mug/ml, respectively, against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli using controls ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin (0.78, 0.39, 1.56 and 0.39 mug/ml and 0.78, 3.125, 3.125, and 1.56 mug/ml).

40441678,2025,"AIMS: Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is a widely used antibiotic for treating bacterial infections, but its safety in adult outpatients remains understudied. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the safety profile of SMX-TMP and identified critical research gaps. The pharmacovigilance study aimed to validate and extend findings from meta-analyses to better understand the real-world safety of SMX-TMP. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Embase up to 12 August 2024, to identify studies comparing adverse drug events (ADEs) following SMX-TMP vs. other antibiotics in adult outpatients. Meta-analyses were performed where data allowed. A pharmacovigilance study using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System was conducted to supplement our findings. RESULTS: Our review, which included 43 studies, found SMX-TMP had a nearly 3-fold higher risk of rash compared to other antibiotics (pooled risk ratio 2.56, 95% confidence interval [1.69, 3.89], I(2) = 0%, n = 4458 participants, 24 randomized control trials). Pharmacovigilance data confirmed a higher frequencies of skin disorders and other ADEs compared to various comparator drugs. Compared to azithromycin, SMX-TMP was associated with a 5-fold increase in Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a 3-fold increase in toxic epidermal necrolysis, and a 10-fold increase in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Additionally, SMX-TMP showed a 10-fold increase in reports of pancytopenia, a 6-fold increase in neutropenia, a 4-fold increase in both thrombocytopenia and aplastic anaemia, a 56-fold increase in hyperkalaemia, and a 10-fold increase in hyponatraemia. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analyses and pharmacovigilance study suggested SMX-TMP was associated with increased risk of ADEs compared to other antibiotics including amoxicillin/clavulanate, azithromycin and nitrofurantoin.

Despite innovation in standardised treatment protocols, it faces challenges due to rising antibiotic resistance, creating the need for alternative treatments. There is a need to synthesize evidence from recent trials to enhance knowledge in critical care practice. This review synthesizes current trial data to strengthen the understanding of the literature. This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) principles. The literature was searched using text terms and controlled vocabulary, employing Boolean operators ""AND,"" ""OR,"" and various combinations across PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Open-access, full-text English papers from 2014 to 2024 involving human-based studies were searched. The quality was assessed using Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Trials, Version 2.0 (ROB 2.0), and the evidence was appraised using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). A total of 68 articles were retrieved through the initial search. After screening and verifying eligibility according to the pre-specified inclusion criteria, the methodological quality of 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. The GRADE tool categorised three high-ROB RCTs as ""low quality."" However, four RCTs had low ROB and were classified as ""high quality."" Eighteen RCTs had uncertain ROB, lowering the evidence by one point to ""moderate quality."" The study found that bismuth-quadruple therapy is an excellent first-line treatment for H. pylori infection, although its adverse effects restrict its use. Vonoprazan Triple Therapy offers a superior eradication rate with improved tolerability, making it an effective treatment option. However, high doses of amoxicillin emerge as the safest and most effective treatment, especially where clarithromycin resistance is prevalent. The management of H. pylori infection is a dynamic process. As resistance patterns evolve and new treatments are developed, it is important for healthcare providers to stay informed about emerging options. Personalized treatment, taking into account patient preferences, tolerability, and concerns about resistance, will likely continue to offer the best chance for successful eradication. Ultimately, the goal is to select the most suitable therapy for each patient, ensuring both the effectiveness and comfort of the treatment.","[('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('gastric disorders', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE')]"
40438220,2025,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to understand the antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular distribution characteristics of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in the region, and to evaluate their correlation. Additionally, the study aims to investigate the transmission status of these strains. METHODS: A total of 150 CRKP collected from January 2019 to December 2021 in the Ningbo region were included in this study. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution method following CLSI guidelines (CLSI, 2023). The tested agents included: (1) basic antimicrobials (tigecycline, polymyxin B, ceftazidime-avibactam); and (2) combination therapy candidates (ertapenem, imipenem, levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, cefepime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftazidime). Resistance genes were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to analyze the molecular characteristics and evolutionary trends of the strains to determine their clonal relationships. RESULTS: The 150 strains of CRKP exhibit high resistance rates to various conventional drugs; The sensitivity rates to tigecycline, polymyxin B, and ceftazidime-avibactam were 98.7, 98.0, and 68%, respectively; Conversely, the sensitivity rates to fosfomycin, amikacin, and chloramphenicol were 72.0, 40.0, and 16.7%, respectively; The main proportions of carbapemen genes producing in CRKP are as follows: KPC-2 (61.3%), NDM-5 (14.7%), IMP-4 (8.0%), OXA-232 (6.0%), and OXA-181 (1.3%); The main proportions of beta-lactamase resistance genes are as follows: CTX-M-1 (13.33%), CTX-M-3 (25.33%), CTX-M-9 (17.33%), CTX-M-14 (34.67%), SHV-1 (26.66%), SHV-11 (66.66%), SHV-12 (18.66%), and SHV-28 (10.00%); CRKP carrying class A, B, and D carbapenemases had a sensitivity rate greater than 96% for tigecycline and polymyxin B, while their sensitivities to ceftazidime-avibactam, aztreonam, and amikacin varied significantly (p < 0.01). Analysis of the MLST results for CRKP revealed that ST11 strains were predominant in the region. There was a significant difference in the resistance genes carried by ST11 strains compared to non-ST11 strains. While different healthcare institutions exhibited variations in ST types, the strains generally showed high homogeneity. CONCLUSION: In the region, CRKP showed high sensitivity to tigecycline, polymyxin B, ceftazidime-avibactam, fosfomycin, amikacin, and chloramphenicol. The main carbapenemase genes identified were KPC-2 and NDM-5. The inhibitory effects of ceftazidime-avibactam, aztreonam, and amikacin varied for CRKP carrying different enzyme types. ST11 strains were predominant in the region. There was a significant difference in the resistance genes carried by ST11 strains compared to non-ST11 strains.

40438085,2025,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to analyse the impact of different antibiotic regimens during non-surgical periodontal therapy on the microbial load of selected periodontitis-associated bacteria (PAB) and the primary therapy outcomes. METHODS: For this aim, 259 patients received steps I and II of periodontal therapy and were included in this clinical trial. 202 patients were treated without the adjunctive use of systemic antibiotics, 18 received amoxicillin (AMOX) as well as metronidazole (MET) and 39 only MET. Subgingival biofilm samples were quantitatively analysed for selected PAB using DNA-DNA-hybridisation-based detection assays for microbial loads of PAB before and 6 months after treatment. Changes in the microbial load of PAB and achievement of a ""treat-to-target"" endpoint (T2T) (</=4 sites with probing depth >/=5 mm) were analysed. Patients' subgingival microbial load was significantly reduced following therapy. RESULTS: 38.2% of the patients achieved T2T. Binary logistic regression adjusted for confounders indicated a relationship between residual PAB levels and not achieving T2T. In patients not receiving systemic antibiotics a 2.4-fold increased risk of not reaching T2T after steps I and II therapy was observed (none vs. MET aOR = 2.38 p = 0.44). Linear regression analysis adjusted for T0 PAB concentration and confounders revealed an increased reduction of PAB levels in patients with systemic antibiotics. No difference in PAB reduction or chance of achieving T2T was observed between MET and MET + AMOX. DISCUSSION: Microbial loads of PAB were found directly associated with periodontal status. As antibiotic treatment with both MET and MET + AMOX similarly reduced microbial loads of PAB, treatment with MET alone may be sufficiently effective as adjunctive to non-surgical periodontal treatment. To confirm this, further prospective studies with bigger sample size are needed.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMOX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMOX', 'CHEMICAL')]"

RESEARCH AIM: To explore management of mastitis/breast abscess in hospital emergency departments (EDs). METHODS: Medical records of patients presented to hospital EDs in Australia, Brazil, Croatia, Germany and Turkiye with lactational mastitis/abscess between 2017 and 2023 were reviewed. Demographic and clinical information (including symptoms, management, and investigations) was extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 580 women with mastitis/breast abscess (646 Emergency Department presentations, mostly in the first 8 weeks postpartum) were identified during the study period. The majority of the women had symptoms of mastitis/breast abscess (breast pain, lump, and inflammation) for > 48 hours before presenting in the Emergency Department. In Australia, culture and sensitivity testing of milk was available for 44% (146/331) of presentations. S. aureus was the most common bacteria isolated (33%, n = 48), of which 6% (n = 3) were methicillin-resistant. The use of diagnostic ultrasound varied between sites, from 5% (3/65) in Croatia to 82% (40/49) in Germany. Breast abscesses were mostly managed by ultrasound-guided aspiration in Australia, whereas incision and drainage was standard care in Germany. Amoxicillin/clavulanate was most commonly prescribed in Croatia (57%, 31/54) and Turkiye (69%, 28/42), whereas flucloxacillin, cephalexin, or cefuroxime was primarily used in Australia (86%, 272/322), Brazil (62%, 66/106), or Germany (80%, 33/41), respectively.

40437354,2025,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) contribute to the global disability burden. Beta-lactams are the most commonly used antibiotics for treating DFIs. However, the use of antibiotics may lead to disruption of the healthy balance of the gut microbiota, causing dysbiosis. METHODS: Patients with infected diabetic foot ulcers (iDFUs) were treated with two kinds of beta-lactams (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ceftazidime) according to microbial sensitivity of causative agents via bolus or continuous administration modes. Changes in the gut microbiome of patients were analyzed. Diabetic patients without iDFUs were used as a control group. 16 S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on stool samples collected from participants. RESULTS: Alpha diversity and beta diversity of gut microbiota of treated patients did not show significant differences between bolus and continuous modes. However, significant differences were observed between gut microbiota diversity of treated patients and control group. PCoA plots showed individualized responses of the patient's gut microbiota to antibiotics at different times using both administration forms associated with the pre-treatment state of microbiota composition. Enterococcus, Sellimonas, and Lachnoclostridium were the common bacterial markers differentially abundant in the gut microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients with iDFUs while Roseburia, Dorea, and Monoglobus were mainly abundant in the gut microbiota of patients without iDFUs. Predicted pathways like ""Transporters"", ""ABC transporters"" and ""Phosphotranspherase system (PTS)"" were upregulated in the gut microbiome of patients treated with bolus regime which may lead to increased intestinal barrier permeability. CONCLUSION: The present study reported alterations in gut microbiota composition and functionality and provided the bacterial markers as well as potential metabolic signatures associated with each administration mode in patients with iDFUs, which may be used as a reference set for future studies of the effect of antibiotics administration on the gut microbiome of patients with iDFUs. This study shed light on the importance of understanding the effect of antibiotic administration form on gut microbiome in patients with iDFUs.

40433630,2025,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are used in periodontal therapy in selected cases, but therapy is rarely guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). Direct AST of the oral microbiota using a combination disk with different antibiotics could provide a new way of AST to guide treatment planning. METHODS: We performed AST of 46 strains of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum complex, Prevotella species, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with a combination disk of amoxicillin (AMX) and metronidazole (MET). The AMX-MET was compared to the largest inhibition zone diameter (IZD) obtained with AMX or MET disks, using an ordinary least square linear regression model. RESULTS: The IZD of the AMX-MET correlated with the AMX for A. actinomycetemcomitans (interception 0.3) and with the MET for Fusobacterium (interceptions -1.25). For Prevotella, the AMX-MET was compared to AMX and MET after 20 and 44 h resulting in a superior correlation after 20 h (interception 0.06 vs 6.61 after 44 h). For P. gingivalis, the AMX-MET was compared to MET after 44 h resulting in an inferior correlation (interception 16.65). CONCLUSION: The IZD of AMX-MET was comparable to that of AMX and MET for important periodontal pathogens, which opens for studies on direct AST of oral samples with a mixed microbiota.

40432826,2024,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing health concern, particularly in Africa, and is predicted to become the leading cause of death after cancer by 2050. Factors like overuse or inappropriate use of antibiotics contribute to this crisis. People living with HIV (PLWH) are particularly vulnerable to AMR with potential drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral and antimicrobial agents against common organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There is limited data on the concentrations of commonly used antimicrobial agents in people living with HIV in resource-limited settings. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) offers a promising approach to optimize antibiotic dosing and improve treatment outcomes for those with sub-optimal drug concentrations. TDM has been recommended for PLWH on anti-tuberculosis treatment due to sub-optimal drug concentrations found in a significant proportion of those with TB. OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this study are to determine the concentrations of selected antimicrobial agents in people living with HIV requiring antimicrobial therapy and to assess the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in achieving therapeutic targets for PLWH receiving rifampicin and isoniazid for the treatment of tuberculosis. METHODS: This prospective observational study will enroll adult PLWH receiving amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, isoniazid, or ceftriaxone. Concentrations of these antibiotics will be measured locally using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods and high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. TDM with dose adjustment will be performed in a subset of participants on TB treatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using non-linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: This study was reviewed and approved by the research and ethics committee in February 2024. Participant enrolment began in September 2024.

40431206,2025,"Urinary actinomycosis is a rare condition, often mimicking a urinary tract tumor. Due to its low prevalence, it can be challenging to diagnose and may be mistaken for malignancies. A 33-year-old female patient with a history of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and recurrent urinary tract infections presented to the emergency room with right renal fossa pain radiating to the right hypochondrium, fever with chills, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination revealed a positive Giordano sign and tenderness at the ipsilateral middle and upper ureteral points. A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed a mass infiltrating the distal third of the right ureter, causing retrograde dilatation and hydronephrosis. Additionally, a liver injury with both liquid and solid components was observed. Therefore, given the suspicion of a urothelial tumor, a diagnostic cystoscopy and ureteroscopy were performed. Using interventional radiology, an abscessed liver lesion was drained, yielding purulent fluid. The histopathological examination revealed no evidence of malignancy. However, due to the strong suspicion of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma, a right radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy was performed. Histopathological examination ultimately confirmed urinary actinomycosis. Consequently, antibiotic therapy with oral amoxicillin 2 g every 12 h was initiated, leading to a good clinical response. Despite its low incidence, urinary actinomycosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases suspected of urothelial tumors in the upper urinary tract.

This study found that 47.1% of E. coli strains were biofilm-producing, with 62.5% exhibiting weak biofilm production, 29.7% mild biofilm production, and 7.8% strong biofilm production. Similarly, 24.2% of the E. coli strains were avian pathogenic E. coli strains due to the presence of five or more virulence genes, specifically tsh, ompA, fimC, iss, fyuA, and astA, in a single strain by multiplex PCR. The present study recommends continuous surveillance and effective control measures to reduce the burden of avian pathogenic E. coli-related infections in poultry.","[('colibacillosis', 'DISEASE'), ('enrofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefepime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('streptomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('kanamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polymyxin B', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('florfenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('O102', 'DISEASE'), ('coli-related infections', 'DISEASE')]"

The objective of the present study was to determine the uterine pathogens in cases of clinical endometritis in two Holstein-Friesian dairy farms between 21 and 27 days after calving and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 14 antimicrobials for Trueperella pyogenes (T. pyogenes). Overall, the prevalence of T. pyogenes (Farms A and B) was 46.3% and 22% (p < 0.01), respectively. In contrast, Farm B had significantly more cases (p < 0.001) of Escherichia coli, but the distribution of uterine pathogens was similar. Regarding the prevalence of any bacteria, Farm B also had significantly more bacteria (p < 0.001) than Farm A. T. pyogenes isolates were highly susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, tylosin, and cephalosporins, such as ceftiofur, cefquinome, and cephalexin with MIC(90) of </=2 mug/mL.

40428897,2025,"Background and Objectives: The transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy-vestibular approach (TOETVA) and parathyroidectomy-vestibular approach (TOEPVA) are scar-free alternatives to conventional surgery but are classified as clean-contaminated due to the oral incision, raising concerns about surgical site infections (SSIs). This study evaluates whether perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (pABX) alone is sufficient compared to extended antibiotic prophylaxis (eABX) in preventing SSIs in TOET/PVA, particularly considering the surgical learning curve. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study analyzed 162 patients undergoing TOET/PVA at a single center from January 2018 to June 2024. Patients were divided into two groups: 82 received eABX (intravenous cefazolin preoperatively plus 7 days of oral amoxicillin/clavulanate), and 80 received pABX alone (intravenous cefazolin). The inclusion criteria included complete postoperative hemogram and C-reactive protein (CRP) records; exclusions comprised other surgical approaches or missing data. Outcomes included postoperative white blood cell (WBC) count, CRP levels, and complications (seroma, cellulitis, and flap perforation), defined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. The statistical analysis comprised t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression, adjusting for confounders like age and sex. Results: The postoperative WBC and CRP levels were significantly higher in the pABX group (p = 0.001), but all values remained within the laboratory normal limits. Complications were observed in 14 patients: seroma in 11, cellulitis in 2, and flap perforation in 1. Complications occurred more frequently in the eABX group but without statistical significance (p = 0.103). The duration of surgery was longer in the eABX group (117.93 +/- 52.35 vs. 72.44 +/- 22.54 min, p = 0.001) and was an independent predictor of complications (OR = 1.018, 95% CI: 1.006-1.031, p = 0.004). Conclusions: Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis alone does not increase the risk of SSIs compared to extended prophylaxis in TOETVA. However, eABX may be prudent during the learning curve due to longer operative times and higher complication risks. Future prospective, randomized trials are needed to standardize prophylaxis regimens.","[('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('cefazolin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefazolin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('seroma', 'DISEASE'), ('cellulitis', 'DISEASE'), ('seroma', 'DISEASE'), ('cellulitis', 'DISEASE')]"
40427235,2025,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Escherichia coli poses a global public health threat, yet companion animals such as dogs remain underrepresented in surveillance efforts. This study investigated risk factors associated with E. coli resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, and enrofloxacin in 263 healthy dogs from urban and rural veterinary clinics in Chile. Fecal samples were collected from dogs that had not received antibiotics in the preceding four weeks, and E. coli isolates growing on antimicrobial-impregnated selective agar were tested using VITEK2, following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. A structured questionnaire captured demographic, clinical, and environmental data, and logistic regression was used to identify significant associations. Resistance rates were 13.3% for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 5.98% for ceftazidime, and 18.3% for enrofloxacin. Dogs purchased from pet stores had 6.04-fold higher odds of ceftazidime resistance compared to adopted dogs (95% CI: 1.88-21.32, p = 0.003). Prior hospitalization increased the risk of enrofloxacin resistance (OR = 4.24, p < 0.001), while cohabitation with healthcare workers reduced the risk of resistance to both enrofloxacin (OR = 0.17, p < 0.001) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (OR = 0.32, p = 0.008). Notably, occasional contact with free-roaming animals also exhibited a protective effect (OR = 0.32, p = 0.011).

The rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), further intensified by shifts in antibiotic prescribing practices during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, poses substantial difficulties in treatment optimization and clinical management. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 644 E. coli strains from urine samples collected in a southeastern Romanian hospital during two periods: pre-pandemic (2018-2019, N = 361) and post-pandemic (2023-2024, N = 283). Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using the VITEK automated system for key antibiotic classes. Results: A significant increase in fluoroquinolone resistance was observed, especially for ciprofloxacin (p = 0.02), alongside rising ceftriaxone resistance (p = 0.004), suggesting the spread of ESBL-producing strains. Resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid remained high, limiting their empirical use. Carbapenem resistance was low (p > 0.1), while nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin retained high efficacy (p = 0.26 and p = 0.64). Conclusions: The post-pandemic period showed a concerning rise in resistance to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins, highlighting the need for stricter antimicrobial stewardship.

With the increasing incidence of cancer, the management of MRONJ poses a growing challenge for clinicians. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of photobiomodulation (PBM) in treating patients with stage I, II, and III medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). Methods: A total of 31 patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 14 patients), with Stage 1 MRONJ; and Group 2 (n = 17 patients), with Stage II and III MRONJ. In total, 10 patients had osteoporosis and 21 underwent cancer treatment. The sole variable under investigation was the stage of MRONJ, as all patients underwent the same photobiomodulation (PBM) procedure. For treatment protocol, PBM with a diode laser was used (Lasotronix Smart M Pro, Piaseczno, Poland) with the following parameters: 100 mW; continuous wave; 635 nm; 4 J/cm(2) for 20 s; irradiance for one point: 0.398 W/cm(2); fluency for one point: 7.96 J/cm(2), and for four points, which was one appointment: 31.83 J/cm(2); and tip diameter 8 mm (three points from buccal surface, perpendicular for the lesion and one point on the floor of the mouth) during each session. The protocol assumed 10 sessions at 3 days intervals. Antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin with clavulanic acid 875 mg + 125 mg or clindamycin 600 mg every 12 h) was started 3 days before PBM and continued for 14 days. Antibiotics were taken for 14 days in total. Pain was measured with VAS scale. Follow-up was after 3 and 6 months. Results: Among the 14 patients in Group 1, none exhibited any clinical signs or symptoms of MRONJ during the 3 months follow-up, and complete cure was achieved. While PBM resolved inflammation and pain in stage II MRONJ, further surgical intervention was necessary to fully address the condition. Conclusions: PBM is an effective treatment for achieving complete recovery in patients with Stage 1 MRONJ. However, in Stages II and III MRONJ, PBM significantly alleviates symptoms but requires complementary surgical intervention to achieve full resolution. A beneficial aspect is the reduction in pain symptoms and the extent of surgical intervention.","[('cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('osteonecrosis', 'DISEASE'), ('Stage II', 'DISEASE'), ('osteoporosis', 'DISEASE'), ('cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Pain', 'DISEASE'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('pain', 'DISEASE'), ('pain', 'DISEASE')]"
40426591,2025,"Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical global health threat, affecting both human and veterinary medicine. Pigeons are increasingly recognized as potential reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to their widespread presence in urban and rural environments. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from pigeons in Hungary. Methods: A total of 73 S. aureus isolates were collected from pigeons across seven regions of Hungary in 2022. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the broth microdilution method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Statistical analysis included correlation heatmaps, hierarchical clustering, network analysis, decision tree modeling, and Monte Carlo simulations. Results: The multidrug-resistant (MDR) prevalence rate was alarmingly high at 80.8%. Very high resistance rates were observed for doxycycline (97.3%), enrofloxacin (87.7%), and amoxicillin (84.9%). By contrast, low resistance rates were detected for vancomycin (5.5%) and imipenem (8.2%). Decision tree modeling identified tiamulin, enrofloxacin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance as the most significant predictors of MDR status. Monte Carlo simulations predicted a mean MDR prevalence of 78.5%, indicating that the dominance of MDR strains is not merely a random phenomenon but part of a broader epidemiological pattern. Conclusions: These findings confirm that pigeons may serve as critical reservoirs of MDR S. aureus strains, posing a potential risk to public and animal health.

40426590,2025,"Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the temporal changes in Helicobacter pylori antibiotic resistance in Russia based on studies published over the past 15 years. Materials and Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, the Russian Science Citation Index, and Google Scholar, following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Our meta-analysis was pre-registered in PROSPERO (CRD 420251025636). The inclusion criteria included original research, published in English or Russian in 2011-2024, involving antibiotic susceptibility testing in treatment-naive Russian adults using validated diagnostic methods. Two independent researchers selected studies and extracted data using standardized procedures, with methodological quality assessed via the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled resistance rates were calculated using fixed/random-effects models in MedCalc 23.1.5 and Python 3.9.21, with meta-regression investigating temporal trends and subgroup analyses examining regional and methodological variations. Results: We identified 16 studies comprising 1206 H. pylori isolates. The pooled analysis of studies (2011-2025) revealed an overall clarithromycin resistance rate of 15.236%, with a significant temporal increase from 11.903% pre-2015 to 21.024% in 2020-2024 (p = 0.0049). Metronidazole showed consistently high pooled resistance (33.309%), while amoxicillin (1.828%), levofloxacin (19.014%), tetracycline (1.328%), and rifampicin (5.803%) maintained low resistance rates, and dual clarithromycin-metronidazole resistance was observed in 2.793% of isolates. Regional disparities were notable in the two largest cities of Russia, with 18.763% clarithromycin resistance in Moscow versus 28.540% in Saint-Petersburg. Conclusions: Russia surpasses the Maastricht VI Consensus resistance threshold for clarithromycin (15%), necessitating revision of empirical treatment strategies.

Descriptive statistics and resistance frequency analyses were conducted. A decision tree classifier and a neural network were trained to predict MDR status. Cross-resistance relationships were visualized using graph-based models, and Monte Carlo simulations estimated MDR prevalence variations. Results: Monte Carlo simulations estimated an average MDR prevalence of 79.6% (95% CI: 73.1-86.1%). Key predictors in MDR classification models were enrofloxacin, neomycin, amoxicillin, and florfenicol. Strong cross-resistance associations were detected between neomycin and spectinomycin, as well as amoxicillin and doxycycline. Conclusions: The high prevalence of MDR strains underscores the urgent need to revise antibiotic usage guidelines in veterinary settings.

40426552,2025,"BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium abscessus (MABS) is an opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic, difficult-to-treat pulmonary infections, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF), leading to rapid lung function decline and increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment is particularly challenging due to the pathogen's resistance mechanisms and the need for prolonged multidrug therapy, which is characterized by poor clinical outcomes and highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Imipenem/relebactam, a novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination, demonstrates in vitro activity against resistant MABS strains and effective pulmonary penetration. Prior research indicates synergistic activity of imipenem with various antibiotics against M. abscessus. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the in vitro activity of imipenem/relebactam, alone and in combination with various antibiotics, against MABS clinical isolates from PwCF (n = 28). METHODS: Susceptibility and synergy were assessed using broth microdilution and checkerboard assays. Extracellular time-kill assays were performed to evaluate the bactericidal activity of synergistic three-drug combinations containing imipenem/relebactam. RESULTS: Imipenem/relebactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity against clinical MABS isolates, exhibiting substantial synergy with cefuroxime, cefdinir, amoxicillin, and cefoxitin. Rifabutin, azithromycin, moxifloxacin, clofazimine, and minocycline also demonstrated additive effects with imipenem/relebactam.

40426542,2025,"Background and Aims: Amoxicillin is one of the most effective antibiotics for treating Helicobacter pylori infections and is widely used in first-line treatment regimens. However, patients with penicillin allergies cannot receive penicillin-based therapies, which significantly limits effective eradication options. This allergy often compels clinicians to choose alternative regimens that may be less effective, thereby increasing the risk of treatment failure. Consequently, therapeutic options for these patients are more restricted, and clinicians must carefully select the most appropriate regimen, taking into account both efficacy and the potential for antimicrobial resistance. This review aims to systematically evaluate the efficacy of penicillin-free treatment regimens for the eradication of H. pylori in patients with penicillin allergies. Specifically, it seeks to identify, analyze, and synthesize current clinical evidence to determine the most effective alternative therapies, thereby supporting evidence-based clinical decision-making. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Scopus databases. We began by reviewing the titles and abstracts of all identified studies to determine eligibility. Next, we assessed the full text of potentially eligible articles according to inclusion and exclusion criteria to establish the eligibility of each study. Results: This review included 26 studies comprising 2713 participants, evaluating penicillin-free therapies for H. pylori eradication in penicillin-allergic patients. Key findings demonstrated high eradication rates with bismuth-based quadruple therapies (88-97%), doxycycline-based regimens (86%), and quinolone-based therapies (75-100%), with Sitafloxacin exceeding 90% efficacy. Minocycline-based regimens also showed promising outcomes, with eradication rates between 80% and 85%. Although the PPI-clarithromycin-metronidazole combination was moderately effective, it was less favored as a first-line option. Overall, bismuth-based and quinolone-based therapies emerged as the most effective alternatives. Conclusions: In patients allergic to penicillin, bismuth quadruple therapy has demonstrated an excellent rate of eradication. Quinolone-based regimens are emerging as a promising alternative in first-line treatment or in cases of treatment failure. Vonoprazan-based therapy is an effective regimen.

40426536,2025,"Background/Objectives: The overuse and misuse of antibiotics has contributed significatively to the growing problem of the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria, posing a serious global challenge to the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases. For these reasons, there is a current and growing interest in the development of effective alternative or complementary strategies to antibiotic therapy for the prevention of fish diseases, which are mainly based on the use of probiotics-in particular, those belonging to the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) group. In this context, the aim of the present study was to characterise, evaluate the genetic diversity and assess the safety of candidate probiotic LAB strains for aquaculture isolated from faeces and intestines of European hakes (Merluccius merluccius, L.) caught in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (Ireland). Methods: The direct antimicrobial activity of the LAB isolates was tested by the Stab-On-Agar method against key ichthyopathogens. Subsequently, their taxonomic classification and genetic diversity were determined by 16SrDNA sequencing and Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR), respectively. To ensure the in vitro safety of the LAB isolates, their biofilm-forming ability was assessed by a microtiter plate assay; their sensitivity to major antibiotics used in aquaculture, human and veterinary medicine by a broth microdilution method and their haemolytic and gelatinase activity by microbiological assays. Results: All LAB isolates were biofilm producers and susceptible to chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline, flumequine and amoxicillin. A total of 30 isolates (85.7%) were resistant to at least one of the tested antibiotics. None of the 35 LAB isolates showed haemolytic or proteolytic activity. Conclusions: Among the isolated strains, five LAB strains exhibiting the highest antimicrobial activity against aquaculture-relevant ichthyopathogens, taxonomically identified as Streptococcus salivarius, Enterococcus avium and Latilactobacillus sakei, were selected for further characterisation as potential probiotic candidates to promote sustainable aquaculture.

40426529,2025,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Proteus mirabilis is a frequent causative agent of urinary tract and wound infections in community and hospital settings. It develops resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (p-AmpC). Here, we report the characteristics of ESBLs and p-AmpC beta-lactamases encountered among hospital and community isolates of P. mirabilis in two hospitals and the community settings in Zagreb, Croatia. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk-diffusion and broth dilution methods. The double-disk-synergy test (DDST) and inhibitor-based test with clavulanic and cloxacillin were applied to screen for ESBLs and p-AmpC, respectively. PCR investigated the nature of ESBL, carbapenemases, and fluoroquinolone resistance determinants. Selected strains were subjected to molecular analysis of resistance traits by the Inter-Array CarbaResist Kit and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: In total, 39 isolates were analyzed. Twenty-two isolates phenotypically tested positive for p-AmpC and seventeen for ESBLs. AmpC-producing organisms exhibited uniform resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate, ESC, ciprofloxacin, and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and uniform susceptibility to carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam and all harbored bla(CMY-16) genes. ESBL-positive isolates demonstrated resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin but variable susceptibility to cefepime and aminoglycosides. They possessed bla(CTX-M) genes that belong to cluster 1 (n = 5) or 9 (n = 12), with CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-65 as the dominant allelic variants. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the presence of CTX-M ESBL and CMY-16 p-AmpC among hospital and community-acquired isolates. AmpC-producing isolates showed uniform resistance patterns, whereas ESBL-positive strains had variable degrees of susceptibility/resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics, resulting in more diverse susceptibility patterns. The study found an accumulation of various resistance determinants among hospital and outpatient isolates, mandating improvement in detecting beta-lactamases during routine laboratory work.","[('Proteus mirabilis', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ESBLs', 'DISEASE'), ('mirabilis', 'DISEASE'), ('double-disk-synergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cloxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ESBLs', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Kit', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('piperacillin-tazobactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefepime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('community-acquired', 'DISEASE'), ('non-beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL')]"

The development of chromium-doped hydroxyapatite coatings in a PVA matrix enriched with amoxicillin aims to provide new biomaterials with improved physico-chemical and biological properties, making them promising candidates for biomedical applications. Methods: Through ultrasound studies, we obtained valuable information on the stability of the samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, metallographic microscopy (MM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were employed for the characterization of the samples. The biocompatibility of the CrHApAPV and CrHApAPV-Ax coatings was assessed using the MG63 human osteoblast-like cell line. To evaluate the cytotoxic potential of these coatings, the cell viability was quantified using the MTT assay after 24 h of incubation. The antibacterial activity of the coatings was evaluated with the aid of the reference strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (P. aeruginosa). Results: The XRD patterns of CrHApAPV and CrHApAPV-Ax samples were examined to evaluate the effects of PVA and amoxicillin on the lattice parameters, unit cell volume, and average crystallite sizes. The results of the in vitro antibacterial assay demonstrated that both the CrHApAPV and CrHApAPV-Ax coatings exhibited very good antibacterial properties for all the tested time intervals.

40426517,2025,"Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses an increasing threat to animal health and food safety. In the poultry sector, particularly in waterfowl farming, the widespread use of antibiotics may contribute to the dissemination of resistant Escherichia coli strains. This study aims to map the antibiotic resistance profiles of E. coli isolates from geese in Hungary, determine the prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains, and analyze resistance patterns and co-resistance relationships. Methods: E. coli isolates from clinical cases between 2022 and 2023 were examined using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Susceptibility results were evaluated based on the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) breakpoints. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to identify resistance patterns. Co-resistance relationships were examined through network analysis, while Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the expected prevalence of MDR strains. Results: Among the examined isolates, neomycin resistance was particularly high (86.8%), while florfenicol (73.6%) and amoxicillin (65.9%) resistance levels were also significant. The prevalence of MDR strains was 86.8%, and XDR strains accounted for 38.5%. Co-resistance analysis revealed a strong correlation between neomycin and spectinomycin resistance, as well as amoxicillin and doxycycline resistance. Monte Carlo simulations estimated that the expected range of MDR strain prevalence could vary between 80.2% and 92.3%. Conclusions: The high prevalence of MDR and XDR strains highlights the urgent need to reassess antibiotic usage strategies in goose farming. These findings underscore the importance of targeted antibiotic use, continuous microbiological surveillance, and the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches to mitigate AMR.","[('Co-resistance', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('florfenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Co-resistance', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('spectinomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MDR', 'DISEASE')]"

The microbial resistance profiles and the optimal choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in shoulder arthroplasty revision are less well characterized compared to those in knee or hip arthroplasty revision. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study constitutes a novel comparative analysis, providing valuable insights into the presence of joint-specific pathogen resistance and the empirical treatment accuracy of shoulder and knee arthroplasties. A review of all the revision cases following primary shoulder and knee arthroplasties conducted between January 2012 and December 2023 was performed. Cases that required revision because of PJIs were identified, and microbial cultures were analyzed to determine the presence of pathogens and their resistance profiles. Results: The most administered postoperative empirical antibiotics were cefuroxime and amoxicillin-sulbactam. A statistically significant difference in the prevalence of anerobic pathogens was observed between total shoulder arthroplasty and knee arthroplasty. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference was observed in the sensitivities of pathogens to metronidazole (p < 0.001) and erythromycin (p = 0.014).

This study provides genomic insights into antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) circulating across the pork production chain, using a 'farm-to-fork' approach. Methods: A total of 417 samples were collected from various points along the production continuum, including the farm (n = 144), transport (n = 60), and abattoir (n = 213). E. coli isolates were identified using the Colilert-18 system, and their phenotypic resistance was tested against 20 antibiotics. Thirty-one isolates were selected for further characterization based on their resistance profiles and sampling sources, utilizing whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Results: The isolates exhibited varying resistance to critical antibiotics used in both human and animal health, including ampicillin (31/31, 100%), tetracycline (31/31, 100%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (29/31, 94%), chloramphenicol (25/31, 81%), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (10/31, 33%). Genetic analysis revealed the presence of resistance genes for beta-lactams (bla(EC), bla(TEM)), trimethoprim/sulfonamides (dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA12, sul2, sul3), tetracyclines (tetA, tetB, tetR, tet34), aminoglycosides (aadA, strA, aph variants), and phenicols (catB4, floR, cmlA1), most of which were plasmid-borne. Virulome analysis identified 24 genes, including toxins and adhesion factors. Mobile genetic elements included 24 plasmid replicons, 43 prophages, 19 insertion sequence families, and 7 class 1 integrons. The E. coli isolates belonged to a diverse range of sequence types, demonstrating significant genetic variability. Further phylogenomic analysis revealed eight major clades, with isolate clustering by sequence type alongside South African environmental and clinical E. coli strains, regardless of their sampling source.

40426067,2025,"BACKGROUND: Recent worldwide reports of increased numbers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) isolates, particularly those producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), are alarming. P. mirabilis is a common causative agent of complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), particularly in patients with long-term urinary catheterization. This study aimed to assess the prevalence, antibiotic resistance patterns, and determinants of P. mirabilis among catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTI) and non-catheter-associated UTIs (non-CAUTI). METHODS: One hundred and three Proteus strains isolated from 613 UTI patients in Minia, Egypt, were examined for antibiotic resistance patterns, ESBL production, and sulphonamide resistance phenotypically. Class 1 and 2 integrons, ESBL, and sul resistance genes were detected by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by molecular typing of ESBL-producing isolates from catheterized UTI patients using ERIC-PCR. RESULTS: Proteus isolates were detected in 20% of the UTIs, with a higher rate among inpatients (27.3%) compared to outpatients (10.6%). Proteus was more significantly isolated from catheterized UTI patients (28.2%, 55/195) than from non-catheterized patients (14.9%, 48/321). Of the 103 Proteus isolates, 99 (96.1%) were identified as P. mirabilis. High resistance was observed against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (80.6%), amoxicillin-clavulanic (AMC) (57.3%), ceftazidime (55.3%), and imipenem (46.6%) antibiotics. Significantly higher resistance rates were observed among Proteus isolates from inpatients and catheterized patients. Of the 103 Proteus strains, 81 (78.6%) were MDR, with 70.9% of the isolates from catheterized patients. About 74.6% of the isolates from inpatients were MDR. Sul genes were detected in 77 isolates (74.7%). The frequency of ESBL-producing Proteus isolates was 37.9% which was significantly higher in catheterized patients with increasing dissemination of bla(TEM) genes and bla(CTX-M) genes. Int1 and Int2 genes were detected in 92.2% and 68.9% of isolates, respectively. ERIC-PCR revealed moderate similarity (65%) between ESBL-producing Proteus isolates from catheterized patients. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of MDR P. mirabilis strains isolated from UTIs in Egypt, particularly among catheterized patients, is a major concern, especially with disseminating class 1 and 2 integrons among isolates. The study also highlights the decreased susceptibility to sulphonamides, 3rd generation cephalosporins, and imipenem, commonly used to treat UTIs. Increased dissemination of ESBL-producing Proteus isolates among CAUTIs complicates their treatments. This important pathogen deserves more attention in the future for a better understanding of resistance mechanisms and the dissemination potential of resistant strains.","[('Proteus mirabilis', 'DISEASE'), ('P. mirabilis', 'DISEASE'), ('mirabilis', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('mirabilis', 'DISEASE'), ('catheter-associated UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTI', 'DISEASE'), ('non-catheter-associated UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus', 'DISEASE'), ('UTI', 'DISEASE'), ('sulphonamide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('UTI', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus', 'DISEASE'), ('UTI', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus', 'DISEASE'), ('trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('SXT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Proteus', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('sulphonamides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Proteus', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTIs', 'DISEASE')]"

MRSA isolates exhibited complete resistance to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. Characterization results indicated an increased inhibition zone diameter and enhanced encapsulation integrity. UV-visible spectrophotometric analysis revealed that ciprofloxacin-loaded liposomes achieved an entrapment efficiency of 16.45% after 1 h, increasing to 76% after 24 h. Encapsulation of ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cloxacillin, and vancomycin within vesicles demonstrated improved antimicrobial efficacy against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and MRSA. Moreover, liposome-encapsulated aminoglycosides exhibited promising potential against A. baumannii, particularly in localized infections where sustained drug concentrations at the infection site are essential.

In severe cases, the drug antibodies may lead to hemolytic anemia, ineffective transfusion, and even life-threatening conditions. However, current methods for detecting drug-induced antibodies present several limitations: cumbersome operational workflows, time-consuming processes, suboptimal sensitivity for low-titer antibodies, and ease of disturbance by autoantibodies and erythrocyte alloantibodies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a drug antibody detection method with operational simplicity, ultrahigh sensitivity, and interference resistance. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from patients with drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA). Based on the established assay protocol, nine reaction systems were prepared and sequentially analyzed by flow cytometry. The results of flow cytometry were used to determine the presence or absence of drug antibodies, identify the specific type of drug antibody, and assess the antibody titer. RESULTS: Different drug antibodies, including ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and amoxicillin, were identified in all six patients with DIIHA. Upon discontinuation of the implicated antibiotics, the efficacy of blood transfusions in those six patients showed significant improvement.

Local drug delivery systems (DDSs) offer an alternative by localising antibiotics and thereby limiting their side effects while reducing the dosage necessary. A biodegradable polyester polycaprolactone (PCL)-based DDS was thus produced, containing various clinically relevant drugs. It was shown that the incorporation of four distinct antibiotic classes (amoxicillin, doxycycline, metronidazole and rifampicin), with very high mass fractions ranging up to 20 wt%, was feasible within the PCL matrix. This DDS showed the capacity for effective and sustained release. The release kinetics over 14 days were proven, showing a significant decrease in cytotoxicity with smooth muscle cells as well as an antibacterial effect on (1) aerobic, (2) anaerobic, (3) Gram-positive and (4) Gram-negative pathogens in vitro. The DDS demonstrated a markedly diminished cytotoxic impact owing to sustained release in comparison to pure antibiotics, while simultaneously maintaining their antibacterial efficacy.

The aim of this study was to compare the toxicity of amoxicillin, polyphosphate ester amoxicillin complex and phosphate ester on mice. Synthesis of the polyphosphate ester (P4) was performed via polycondensation technique, using PEG-400. Animal studies were performed in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals (Strasbourg, 1986). BALB/c mice were treated by intramuscular injection with saline 0.2 mL (control), amoxicillin 0.2 mL (15 mg/kg); polyphosphate ester complex with amoxicillin 0.2 mL (with amoxicillin content 15 mg/kg) and polyphosphate ester 0.2 mL. Blood biochemical analysis and histology of liver, spleen and kidney were used to assess toxicity. Blood biochemical analysis indicates that P4 did not induce changes in liver and kidneys. Specifically, blood biochemical indicis that represent functional state and cell structure of these organs were within normal physiological values: ALT (56 +/- 15.96 U/L), AST (265 +/- 37.50U/L), urea (4.4 +/- 1.45 mmol/L), creatinine 62.8 +/- 5.17 mmol/L, cholesterol 3.5 +/- 0.56 mmol/L, total protein 55.9 +/- 4.60 g/L, glucose 8.1 +/- 0.55 mmol/L. However, the analysis of organ to body weight ratio showed decreased liver ratio (p </= 0.05) in mice injected with polyphosphate ester (P4). Histological examination of the liver didn't show severe pathological changes. There were single places with mild portal vein inflammation in liver of mice receiving amoxicillin and amoxicillin complexed with polyphosphate ester. P4 separately in some places caused cell cytoplasm granulation in liver. No spleen alterations were observed. Overall, the results of this study showed that P4 polyphosphate ester alone and in complex with amoxicillin does not cause renal, hepatic and splenic toxicity in mice. Thus, polyphosphate ester P4 can serve as a safe drug carrier for antimicrobial drugs. It is planned to carry out more extensive studies on other animal species to study its biocompatibility and effectiveness of antimicrobial activity in a complex with antimicrobials.","[('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('decreased toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polyphosphate ester amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('phosphate ester', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polyphosphate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('PEG-400', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polyphosphate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polyphosphate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('P4', 'CHEMICAL'), ('urea', 'CHEMICAL'), ('creatinine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cholesterol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('glucose', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polyphosphate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('portal vein inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polyphosphate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polyphosphate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hepatic and splenic toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('polyphosphate', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40413264,2025,"Detecting and quantifying trace amounts of antibiotics like amoxicillin and oxytetracycline in milk and environmental water samples is crucial for public health and environmental monitoring. This research focuses on developing a novel sorbent for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of amoxicillin and oxytetracycline from milk and environmental water samples, using electrospun graphene oxide-doped poly(acrylonitrile-co-maleic acid) nanocomposite fibers, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The fibers were successfully fabricated and characterized using a suite of techniques: SEM-EDX, FTIR, XRD, BET, XPS, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy. The extraction process was optimized by carefully adjusting parameters like desorption solvent (0.60 mL of 0.2 M HCl in methanol), extraction time (60 min), and sample pH (3) to achieve efficient and reliable extraction. Under optimal conditions, the developed method demonstrated good linearity (5-100 microg/L, R(2) > 0.9925), low detection and quantification limits (1.50 microg/L and 5.0 microg/L for amoxicillin and 1.46 microg/L and 4.8 microg/L for oxytetracycline) and high enrichment factor (21 for amoxicillin and 47 for oxytetracycline). The achievable accuracy and precision of the developed sorbent were satisfying, for incidence, relative recovery range of 90.3-106.3% and 87.6-95.9% with RSD range of 1.9-4.3% and 1.1-4.7% for amoxicillin and oxytetracycline, respectively.

40412815,2025,"BACKGROUND: Since Indonesia implemented one of the world's largest single-payer health insurance schemes in 2014, the price of many common medicines has fallen dramatically. Industry groups warn unsustainably low prices threaten quality, while the government says medicines remain overpriced. We investigate the relationship between the price and quality of essential medicines and the affordability of medicines paid for out of pocket. METHODS: We bought over 1000 samples of five common prescription medicines-allopurinol, amlodipine, amoxicillin, cefixime and dexamethasone-online and from randomly selected pharmacies and health facilities in four regions across Indonesia. We recorded the price paid and tested samples for quality using high-performance liquid chromatography. We compared prices with the median and lowest prices for each medicine, tested for correlation between quality and price, and calculated affordability compared with the district minimum wage. RESULTS: Medicines available in the public procurement system were less likely to fail quality testing than other brands/varieties (4.2% vs 8.3%) but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.086). There was no other relationship between quality and price, or branded status. Branded generic medicines sold at a large variety of price points, from 0.3 to 18.6 times the median price for the medicine and dose (IQR: 0.9-5.0, median 1.4). Unbranded generics traded in a narrower range (range 0.1-2.6; IQR 0.6-1.0, median 0.8). Medicines were most expensive in the region with the lowest wages, but even there, medicines selling at the 25th percentile of available prices cost a maximum of 0.7% of 1 day's wage for a course. CONCLUSION: In every study district, we found that Indonesian patients working at the minimum wage could access affordable, quality-assured versions of all studied essential medicines. More expensive brands were also widely available, but there was no relationship between price and quality.","[('amlodipine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefixime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('dexamethasone-online', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40410730,2025,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial-resistant Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species are emerging as serious public health risks, both globally and in resource-limited countries such as Ethiopia. These microorganisms cause serious, life-threatening infections and are becoming increasingly resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics. The high prevalence and resistance patterns of these bacteria need immediate action to inform treatment guidelines, increase infection control measure, and develop effective public health policies. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence of phenotypic drug resistance profiles and multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species recovered from clinical specimens in Ethiopia. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis, which followed PRISMA principles, analyzed data from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to determine the prevalence and antibiotic resistance trends of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species in Ethiopia. Eligible studies were extracted by using Microsoft Excel and exported to STATA version 17 for analysis. The pooled prevalence was estimated using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity was examined using the I(2) statistic. Publication bias was investigated using funnel plot analysis and Egger's test, and sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of individual studies on the total pooled findings. RESULT: Of the 1,375 studies identified, 187 were eligible for qualitative analysis, leading to the inclusion of 65 studies in the meta-analysis. This analysis encompassed a total of 1,264 isolates, with 364 identified as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species. The systematic review revealed a pooled prevalence of 19.12% (95% CI: 14.86-23.38) for Pseudomonas species and 12.46% (95% CI: 5.82-19.10) for Acinetobacter species. The combined prevalence of both pathogens was 25.31 (95% CI: 18.61-32.00) with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 93.6%, p < 0.001). across the studies. Pseudomonas exhibited high resistance rates to amoxicillin-clavulanic Acid (83.73%) and tetracycline (89.15%), while Acinetobacter showed 87.21% resistance to tetracycline and 79.72% to ceftriaxone. The overall pooled prevalence of MDR Pseudomonas species was 72.73% (95% CI: 67.02-78.44), and for Acinetobacter species, it reached 84.69% (95% CI: 78.78-90.59), respectively. Moreover, the pooled prevalence of MDR for both species isolated from clinical samples in Ethiopia was 74.79% (95% CI: 70.14-79.43), with significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 99.7%, p < 0.001) across the studies. CONCLUSION: The pooled prevalence of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species and their antibiotic resistance were alarmingly high in clinical samples in Ethiopia.

A combined 439 bacterial isolates were obtained, with the dominance of Gram-negative pathogens, including Escherichia coli (16.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.3%). Staphylococcus aureus was also the dominant Gram-positive pathogen (12.8%). Polymicrobial infections were found in 43.1% of cases, and 71% of strains were biofilm-producing. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) was alarmingly high (67%), particularly among Escherichia coli (97.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (83.9%), and Proteus mirabilis (90.5%). MDR infections were associated with tobacco use, biofilm formation, polymicrobial infection, and clinical complications. In specific, seven bacterial types, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Providencia rettgeri, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas flourescens, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, as described, were statistically associated with amputation. Beta-lactams (ampicillin, piperacillin) showed 100% resistance. Cephalosporins (ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefepime) had resistance rates ranging from 25 to 96%. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid showed 30 to 92.3% resistance, while piperacillin-tazobactam ranged from 7.7 to 71.4% resistance.

40408044,2025,"The escalating threat of antibiotic resistance, particularly in Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains, MRSA), underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutics. Sofalcone (Sof), a chalcone derivative from Sophora subprostrata with established anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer properties, exhibits promising yet underexplored antibacterial activity. Here, we demonstrate that Sof potently inhibits S. aureus and MRSA while showing minimal cytotoxicity in human cells. Notably, Sof synergized with amoxicillin, and significantly reduced the pathogenicity of S. aureus through inhibiting biofilm formation addressing key virulence factors. Through chemoproteomic profiling using a clickable Sof-derived probe, ribosomal proteins, specifically the 50S subunit protein rplB, were identified as primary targets. Sof covalently binds to rplB via cysteine residues, as validated by cellular thermal shift assays, microscale thermophoresis, and competition assays. Bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging revealed that Sof disrupts bacterial protein synthesis by impairing ribosomal function, a mechanism distinct from conventional antibiotics. In a murine model of S. aureus-induced acute lung injury, Sof greatly reduced bacterial load in lungs, attenuated systemic inflammation, and mitigated histopathological damage. Its dual antibacterial and anti-inflammatory efficacy, coupled with activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli, highlights broad-spectrum potential. This study unveils a covalent ribosomal-targeting strategy, positioning Sof as a multifaceted candidate against multidrug-resistant infections.

40405772,2025,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) procedures with extended biliary limb length are gaining popularity to expedite weight loss but can induce liver failure. We aimed to investigate the underlying pathophysiology for this potentially fatal complication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared mouse models of vertical sleeve plication, sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and one-anastomosis gastric bypass with three biliary limb lengths (25% = Omega1, 50% = Omega2, 75% = Omega3) by analyzing mortality, weight loss, metabolic and liver health, bacterial translocation, inflammation, and biliary and fecal microbiome. Gut decontamination with oral antibiotics (amoxicillin, vancomycin, neomycin, and metronidazole) was performed in a subset of Omega3 mice. Liver histology from mice with different biliary limb lengths was compared to samples from human patients who developed liver failure following biliopancreatic diversion or RYGB. RESULTS: RYGB and Omega1&2 significantly improved glucose intolerance and liver steatosis compared to sham surgery. However, extending the biliary limb (Omega3) resulted in 100% mortality. The Omega3 procedure induced bacterial translocation of enterococcus genus to the spleen and biliary fluid, consistent with increased serum lipopolysaccharide levels and terminal ileum, biliary limb, and hepatic inflammation. Liver histology in Omega3 mice was characterized by mediovesicular steatosis, closely resembling the histological picture observed in patients with liver failure after MBS. Oral gut decontamination significantly improved Omega3 one-week-survival from 31.3% to 80.0%, prevented bacterial overgrowth in biliary fluid and spleen, and decreased liver damage. CONCLUSION: Mortality in longer biliary limb MBS surgery is caused by bacterial overgrowth, translocation, and gut-liver axis inflammation, which were reversed by oral gut decontamination with antibiotics.","[('weight loss', 'DISEASE'), ('liver failure', 'DISEASE'), ('Omega3', 'CHEMICAL'), ('weight loss', 'DISEASE'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Omega3', 'CHEMICAL'), ('liver failure', 'DISEASE'), ('glucose intolerance', 'DISEASE'), ('steatosis', 'DISEASE'), ('Omega3', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Omega3', 'CHEMICAL'), ('lipopolysaccharide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('Omega3', 'CHEMICAL'), ('steatosis', 'DISEASE'), ('liver failure', 'DISEASE'), ('Omega3 one-week-survival', 'CHEMICAL'), ('decreased liver damage', 'DISEASE'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE')]"

We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare and rank the effectiveness of antibiotics for adult patients with CAP. METHODS: The databases of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library were systematically searched until May 2025, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing at least two antibiotics for hospitalized adults with CAP. The investigated outcomes included clinical failure, bacteriological failure, mortality, total adverse events, gastrointestinal events, and requiring discontinuation of treatment. RESULTS: Forty RCTs involving 12,838 hospitalized adults with CAP were selected for the final meta-analysis. The surface under the cumulative ranking probabilities (Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Area, SUCRA; higher values indicate a greater likelihood of a treatment being the most effective) found that trovafloxacin (SUCRA: 87 %) and teicoplanin (SUCRA: 85 %) provided relatively better effects on clinical failure.

This study evaluated the impact of heavy metals on antibiotic resistance patterns of Escherichia coli in wastewater from slums of Bwaise II, Bwaise III, Kazo, and Makerere III in Kawempe division, Kampala. METHODS: Levels of heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, and arsenic) in wastewater were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Escherichia coli were isolated from wastewater using MacConkey agar and their susceptibility to 50 microl of stock antibiotics (tetracycline, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone at 30 microg/ml, and ciprofloxacin at 5 microg/ml) determined. The potential of heavy metals to induce antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli was determined by culturing susceptible isolates in 200 microl of Luria-Bertina broth containing stock antibiotics (10 microl), or stock antibiotics (10 microl) and stock heavy metals (10 microl). Stock heavy metals were prepared from the average concentration of heavy metals detected in wastewater. RESULTS: Detectable levels of heavy metals were reported in wastewater from Bwaise II, Kazo and Makerere III only. Lead, cadmium and arsenic, mercury and chromium, were highest in Bwaise II, Kazo, and Makerere III, respectively. The occurrence of Escherichia coli resistant to at least an antibiotic was 72.8% (169 of 232) and resistance to tetracycline, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin were 34.1%, 28.9%, 35.3%, and 34.5%, respectively. Study findings further revealed a positive correlation (R(2) = 0.371-0.985) between the presence of heavy metals in wastewater and antibiotic resistance patterns of Escherichia coli. Also, heavy metals; lead (77.41 microg/ml), mercury (1.44 microg/ml), and cadmium (10.21 microg/ml) significantly (p < 0.05) induced antibiotic resistance in susceptible Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: Wastewater in Kawempe slums is polluted with heavy metals and high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli.

40398951,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but assessments of antimicrobial consumption (AMC) are limited. This study aimed to investigate regional AMC and resistance patterns in a representative area of Tanzania and to introduce a method for determining AMC in low-resource settings. DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using prescription data collected over 5 years (2013-2017) from multiple hospitals and selected primary health facilities in the Dodoma Region of Tanzania. The study employed the WHO's Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification and Daily Defined Dose (DDD) methodology to quantify antimicrobial use. Outpatient prescription records that met our inclusion criteria were analysed, while incomplete records were excluded. Sensitivity testing for frequently prescribed antimicrobials was performed against representative gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, with resistance expressed as minimum inhibitory concentrations and resistance percentages. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted across several high-volume healthcare facilities in the Dodoma Region, encompassing both hospital and primary care settings. The dataset comprises outpatient prescription records from these facilities, representing a significant proportion of the regional healthcare usage. The selected facilities were chosen based on their substantial catchment populations to maximise data volume and relevance. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) for various antimicrobial classes. Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of specific drugs, such as amoxicillin and erythromycin, and their corresponding resistance profiles. Resistance data were quantitatively analysed, with particular attention given to penicillinase-sensitive penicillins and their resistance rates among gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that single penicillins, particularly amoxicillin, dominated prescriptions, accounting for 25% to 60% of hospitals and 13% to 29% of primary health centres. Erythromycin was prescribed in 9.4% to 25.1% of cases across facilities. The overall AMC in the region ranged from 36.7 to 50.2 DID during the study period, with consumption patterns showing an initial increase of 4.3% from 2013 to 2014, a subsequent 29.0% decrease from 2014 to 2015, followed by a 34.1% increase from 2015 to 2016 and a further 37.9% increase from 2016 to 2017. Resistance testing demonstrated that penicillinase-sensitive penicillins exhibited an average resistance rate of 87.3%, with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria showing resistance levels of 90.1% (+/-8%) and 83.6% (+/-8%), respectively, indicating a statistically significant association (p<0.05) between high consumption and elevated resistance. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that AMC in the Dodoma Region is high and is linked to significant resistance against commonly used agents. This study presents a robust method for monitoring AMC and resistance in a resource-efficient manner, offering potential applicability in similar settings across SSA. The data, though representing only a fraction of total antimicrobial use, underscore the urgent need for targeted antimicrobial stewardship interventions, particularly at the primary healthcare level. Future research should further investigate demographic influences and evaluate intervention strategies to mitigate AMR effectively.","[('gram-negative', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gram-negative', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DID', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gram-negative', 'DISEASE')]"

The laboratory received 2026 urine samples during the study period, of which 606 (29.97%) showed bacterial growth, and from these samples, 883 bacterial strains were recovered. The most common gram-positive bacterial species included Enterococcus faecalis (n = 123), Staphylococcus felis (n = 50), and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (n = 28), while the most common gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (n = 322) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 18). Among the gram-positive isolates, none of the Enterococcus faecalis isolates showed resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ampicillin. In addition, Staphylococcus felis isolates showed low resistance to ampicillin (7.32%), enrofloxacin (4.88%), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (4.88%). Among gram-negative bacteria, E. coli isolates showed a high resistance to ampicillin (30.64%), and a moderate resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (11.78%) and cefovecin (11.11%), antibiotics considered as first-line choices to treat UTIs in cats.

40388525,2025,"BACKGROUND: Limited research has examined the direct effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori eradication (HPE) on the remnant stomach neoplasms after curative gastrectomy. This study aims to assess whether HPE could prevent the development of gastric neoplasms in the remnant stomach after curative gastrectomy through a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. METHODS: After curative gastrectomy, patients with HP infection and pathologically proven stage 1 tumors will be enrolled and randomly assigned to eradication (n = 492) and placebo (n = 492) groups. Patients in the eradication arm will be given the eradication regimen, which will comprise 40 mg of esomeprazole, 1 g of amoxicillin, and 500 mg of clarithromycin twice a day for 14 days. The primary endpoint is the development of gastric neoplasms, including adenoma or adenocarcinoma. The secondary endpoints are the 10-year overall survival, improvement rates of gastric glandular atrophy and/or intestinal metaplasia, and incidence of new-onset hyperplastic polyps among the groups. SIGNIFICANCE: This research will be the first randomized controlled clinical study in which a thorough long-term follow-up will be needed to evaluate the effectiveness of HPE for remnant stomach neoplasms after curative gastrectomy. Its results will serve as a basis for developing future strategies in the management of patients with HP infection who undergo curative gastrectomy.

40387518,2025,"Pulpitis is a painful inflammatory condition of the dental pulp, commonly triggered by bacterial infection, trauma, or repeated dental procedures. Patients often experience heightened sensitivity to temperature changes, spontaneous pain, and, in severe cases, necrosis of the pulp tissue, leading to tooth loss if left untreated. Traditional treatment primarily involves root canal therapy, which removes infected pulp and seals the canal with gutta-percha; however, this approach lacks antimicrobial properties and does not support tissue regeneration. To address these limitations, this study investigates an injectable hydrogel system composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCs), chemically crosslinked with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE). The hydrogel demonstrated excellent injectability, self-healing ability, and mechanical stability. In vitro and in vivo assessments confirmed its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and capability for controlled release of therapeutic agents. Notably, the amoxicillin-loaded hydrogel (HACM/AX) showed significant antibacterial properties; while the erythropoietin-loaded hydrogel (HACM/EPO) significantly enhanced endothelial cell proliferation and migration, facilitating angiogenesis for tissue regeneration. These findings highlight the potential of the HACM hydrogel as a dual-function biomaterial with antimicrobial and pro-angiogenic properties, offering a promising alternative for pulpitis treatment and dental tissue engineering.","[('Pulpitis', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial infection', 'DISEASE'), ('trauma', 'DISEASE'), ('pain', 'DISEASE'), ('necrosis', 'DISEASE'), ('tooth loss', 'DISEASE'), ('carboxymethyl chitosan', 'CHEMICAL'), ('1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether', 'CHEMICAL'), ('BDDE', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-loaded', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pulpitis', 'DISEASE')]"

The samples were filtered, extracted by solid phase, and analyzed by PerkinElmer Flexar HPLC. Samples showed ambient temperature, around neutral pH, and high electrical conductivity, salinity, total dissolved salts, and turbidity. Acetaminophen and diclofenac were detected at concentrations of 40.00-44.00 and 77.00-553.00 mug/L, respectively, in KNUST samples.

DESIGN: This study utilized a retrospective study design. METHODS: We retrospectively observed medical records from August 2023 to February 2024 at Manmohan Memorial Teaching Hospital in Nepal, focusing on patients with significant bacterial growth in urine samples and antibiotic sensitivity analysis for resistance trends. RESULTS: Escherichia coli (E. coli) (64.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (15.0%) were the most common uropathogens. Both showed the highest resistance to amoxicillin (>95%), while E. coli demonstrated the lowest resistance to gentamicin (7.4%) and nitrofurantoin (12.2%). Klebsiella pneumoniae also showed low resistance to gentamicin (12.0%) but higher resistance to nitrofurantoin (64.0%).

This opportunistic pathogen can cause urinary tract infections, respiratory infections and septicaemia, but endocarditis is particularly rare and concerning due to its rapid and devastating progression. We report the first documented case worldwide of infective endocarditis (IE) caused by S. marcescens producing NDM-type carbapenemase, and the second reported case of S. marcescens endocarditis in a preterm infant. The patient was a preterm male infant born at 34 weeks of gestation, from a triplet pregnancy, admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit on day 2 of life for respiratory distress. The mother, aged 39, had undiagnosed gestational diabetes. Premature rupture of membranes had occurred 10 days before delivery, necessitating prophylactic treatment with amoxicillin. On day 4 of life, the newborn developed a fever with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and leucocytosis, leading to antibiotic therapy with colistin, imipenem and amikacin. Blood cultures revealed the presence of carbapenemase-producing S. marcescens sensitive to fluoroquinolones. A cardiac ultrasound showed a vegetation on the mitral valve, confirming the diagnosis of IE. Despite intensive treatment, the newborn died on day 16 of life due to septic shock. This rare case of endocarditis caused by S. marcescens highlights the severity of this infection in preterm infants. Treatment relies on appropriate antibiotic therapy.

40383390,2025,"Feeding waste milk, a common practice in dairy farming, exposes calves to subtherapeutic levels of antimicrobials, potentially contributing to antibiotic resistance-a growing concern globally. Many dairy farmers, including those in Ireland, continue this practice, feeding waste milk from antibiotic-treated cows to calves. Although previous studies have linked waste milk feeding to changes in calf growth and health during the preweaning period, its effects postweaning remain unclear. This study examined how the duration of antimicrobial exposure at levels equivalent to those found in waste milk influences health and growth outcomes of dairy heifer calves both before and after weaning. It also assessed the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-resistant Escherichia coli in feces and changes in the fecal microbiota over time. To mimic waste milk, as derived from a cow treated with an intramammary suspension of antibiotics, a simulated waste milk (SWM) was prepared by adding amoxicillin (1.68 mg/L) and neomycin (2.28 mg/L) to a conventional milk replacer (MR). The study employed a randomized block design with 87 dairy heifer calves assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) long-term antibiotic (LTA), with calves fed SWM until weaning at 12 wk; (2) short-term antibiotic (STA), with SWM fed from 3 to 5 wk; and (3) control (CONT), with calves fed antibiotic-free MR. Calves were weighed weekly, and health scores, including fecal scores (tail and hindquarters cleanliness as diarrhea indicator), were recorded twice per week. Fecal and blood samples were collected to analyze microbiome changes and the shedding of antimicrobial resistance. Blood samples were taken to measure systemic inflammation, using serum amyloid A as a biomarker. Results indicated that SWM feeding did not affect average daily gains before or after weaning. However, higher fecal scores were observed in the LTA group during weaning and after weaning in the STA group. Antibiotic-resistant isolates were present in all groups, with the highest prevalence in LTA. Fecal microbiota analysis revealed treatment-specific microbial community variations, with increase of Enterococcus faecium genes resistant to macrolide, aminoglycoside, and tetracycline antibiotics in LTA and STA compared with CONT. In summary, SWM feeding did not significantly affect growth or overall health, but it was associated with increased fecal shedding of resistant bacteria and some changes in the microbiota, indicating potential long-term implications for antimicrobial resistance in dairy herds.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('amyloid A', 'CHEMICAL'), ('LTA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('faecium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('macrolide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycoside', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL')]"

40382559,2025,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global challenge that disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Environmental contamination by resistant bacteria from animal production facilities is a major driver of the spread of AMR through the food chain, requiring a robust one-health control approach. Traditional culture-based AMR surveillance is time-consuming and less sensitive, and fails to fully capture the spectrum of AMR, evolutionary trends, and epidemiological patterns of AMR spread. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized AMR surveillance capabilities. Rapid WGS captures the full AMR spectrum with minimum samples, aids source attribution, and provides insights into trends in AMR spread. The portable Oxford Nanopore(R) Technology (ONT) platform, coupled with open-source software such as Galaxy and Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME), enables the establishment of a potentially portable, transferable workflow for low-resource settings. This study aimed to assess the AMR burden on four dairy farms in Kandy, Sri Lanka, via a resource-limited LMIC using a low-cost high-throughput screening assay and rapid WGS via ONT with Galaxy and KNIME processing to obtain full antibiotic resistomes. RESULTS: The four isolates exhibiting the highest minimum inhibitory concentrations for amoxicillin were identified as Enterobacter cloacae and E. hormaechei by WGS. Chromosomes (4.8 to 4.9 Mb) carry the strain-specific resistance genes blaCMH-1, blaACT-25, fosA_7, and ramA, which are associated with diverse antibiotic classes. Plasmids, including IncFIB (pECLA), IncFII (pECLA), and IncX3, carry multiple resistance genes, including AAC(3)-IIe, AAC(6')-Ib-cr, APH(3'')-Ib, APH(6)-Id, blaCTX-M-15, blaNDM, blaOXA-1, blaTEM-1, dfrA14, QnrB17, catII, determinant-of-bleomycin-resistance, and sul2. Novel arrangements of insertion sequences were observed in E. hormaechei plasmids. The phenotypic resistance of all the isolates matched the genotypic MDR profiles, including resistance to chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: ONT WGS with Galaxy and KNIME processing may be a feasible option for AMR surveillance in resource-limited LMICs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-house whole-genome analysis workflow in the country tailored for AMR surveillance. The presence of potentially pathogenic high-MIC, MDR Enterobacter spp. with wide resistomes, including the blaNDM gene, emphasizes the urgent need to address AMR in animal production facilities within a one-health framework.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('APH(6)-Id', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chloramphenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cotrimoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Enterobacter', 'DISEASE')]"

40379253,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Evolving bacterial ecology and resistance warrant re-evaluation of traditional antibiotic regimens for prelabour premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). This study aimed to compare delivery within 7 days of PPROM and overall latency according to different antibiotic regimens. Secondary objectives were to compare adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study utilized data from five Canadian hospitals from 2016-2022. Singleton pregnancies with PPROM at 18-34 weeks of gestation were included. Cases were divided into four groups based on antibiotic regimen administered, and outcomes were compared using logistic and linear regression analyses, controlling for gestational age at PPROM. RESULTS: Of 669 PPROM cases, 50% received ampicillin/amoxicillin and macrolide, and the remainder received macrolide only (30%), macrolide and other (3%), and non-macrolide (17%) regimens. ""Macrolide-only"" was associated with a significantly shorter latency compared to ""ampicillin/amoxicillin with macrolide"" [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for latency </=7 days 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.3, 2.8); and adjusted relative mean overall latency -6.7 days, 95% CI (-9.3, -4.1)]. Compared to other regimens, ""macrolide-only"" was associated with higher rates of maternal clinical and histological chorioamnionitis (37% vs. 14%-25%, P = 0.001, and 74% vs. 52%-61%, P < 0.001, respectively) and neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage (23% vs. 11%-13%, P = 0.009). Among cases of neonatal bacteremia, ampicillin resistance was frequent (11/19; 58%). CONCLUSION: Macrolide alone is inferior to ampicillin/amoxicillin with a macrolide in prolonging pregnancy and preventing adverse outcomes; therefore, its use should be strongly reconsidered in women with penicillin allergy. Broader-spectrum regimens warrant further clinical investigation.

Les objectifs secondaires etaient de comparer les issues maternelles et neonatales defavorables. MeTHODES: Cette etude retrospective multicentrique a utilise les donnees de 5 hopitaux canadiens pour la periode de 2016 a 2022. Les grossesses monofoetales avec une RPMAT a un age gestationnel entre 18 et 34 semaines ont ete incluses. Les cas ont ete divises en quatre groupes en fonction de l'antibiotherapie administree, puis les resultats ont ete compares a l'aide d'analyses de regression logistique et lineaire, en tenant compte de l'age gestationnel au moment de la RPMAT. ReSULTATS: Sur 669 cas de RPMAT, 50 % des patientes ont recu une combinaison d'ampicilline-amoxicilline et d'un macrolide et les autres ont recu un macrolide seul (30 %), un macrolide combine a un autre agent (3 %) ou une antibiotherapie sans macrolide (17 %). L'option << macrolide seul >> a ete associee a une periode de latence significativement plus courte que l'option << combinaison d'ampicilline-amoxicilline et d'un macrolide >> (rapport de cotes ajuste [RCa] pour une periode de latence </= 7 jours : 1,9; intervalle de confiance [IC] a 95 % : 1,3-2,8; et duree de latence globale moyenne relative ajustee de -6,7 jours; IC a 95 % : -9,3 a -4,1). Par rapport aux autres antibiotherapies, l'option << macrolide seul >> a ete associee a des taux plus eleves de chorioamnionite clinique ou histologique maternelle (clinique : 37 % p/r a 14-25 %, p = 0,001; histologique : 74 % p/r a 52-61 %, p < 0,001) et d'hemorragie intraventriculaire neonatale (23 % p/r a 11-13 %, p = 0,009). Dans les cas de bacteriemie neonatale, la resistance a l'ampicilline etait frequente (11/19; 58 %).

However, diagnostic work-up is complex and time-consuming: it requires skin testing (ST) and drug-provocation test (DPT), needing faster delabelling strategies. Although direct DPT without previous STs has shown to be safe, most of the studies are performed in children or in North American, Asian, or Oceanian adults, with few studies in the European adult population. We explored its safety in European adult patients with low-risk PEN allergy history and, additionally, analysed ST role and T-cell involvement by lymphocyte transformation test (LTT). METHODS: We prospectively evaluated > 16 years of PEN-allergic labelled patients referred to Malaga Regional University Hospital during 2023. They reported non-immediate reactions without alarm signs and unknown reactions. Direct-single-dose DPT was performed in all patients. If positive, ST and LTT were carried out after reaction resolution. RESULTS: We included 269 patients with the culprits being an unidentified PEN (36%), amoxicillin (AX) (32%), and AX-clavulanic acid (AX-CLV) (31%); and the symptoms maculopapular exanthema (MPE) (34%) and unknown reaction during childhood (23%). Only 16 (5.9%) had positive DPT, being 56% for AX and 44% for AX-CLV, 81% developing MPE, none severe. Most DPT-reacting patients reported cutaneous non-immediate reactions in the index reaction, and only one had an unknown childhood reaction. The mean day interval between drug administration and symptom development was lower (p = 0.002) in positive DPT than in the index reaction (2 vs 5 days). Moreover, ST was positive in only 19% and LTTs in 86.7% of positive DPT patients. CONCLUSIONS: Direct-single-dose DPT is safe for delabelling PEN allergy in non-immediate reactions without alarm signs and unknown reactions.

However, the effects of beta-lactam antibiotics on conjugation transfer of IncI2 plasmids and the homeostasis of the mouse intestinal microbiota have not been thoroughly investigated. RESULTS: The results revealed that the transfer of IncI2 plasmid was the highest for intra-specific E. coli and inter-specific transfer to Salmonella and K. pneumoniae occurred at much lower levels in the absence of beta-lactam antibiotic selective pressure. Furthermore, inter-species and intra-species transfer of IncI2 plasmid was enhanced in the presence of sub-MIC levels of amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalexin whereas ampicillin promoted only inter-species transfer. These results were consistent with in vivo observations where amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalexin but not ampicillin promoted conjugation. Meanwhile, the intestinal microbiota was also disturbed following antibiotic treatment and Proteobacteria abundance increased while Bacteroides decreased. The gut microbiota could also be partially restored to initial levels after antibiotic cessation for 14 days.

To address this concern, we assessed the quality of antibiotics purchased without a prescription at private drug retail outlets (PDROs) in Indonesia. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Tabalong and Bekasi, Indonesia, using standardised patients (SPs) who purchased antibiotics without a prescription for three clinical scenarios: upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), tuberculosis (TB) and child diarrhoea. The pharmacies and drug stores were randomly selected from each subdistrict based on the probability proportional method. We measured the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content of the antibiotic samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). SAMPLES AND ANALYSIS: The quality of 183 antibiotics including amoxicillin tablets (148/183, 80.9%, 95% CI 74.7% to 86.1%), amoxicillin dry syrup (12/183, 6.6%, 95% CI 3.6% to 10.8%), ampicillin tablets (5/183, 2.7%, 95% CI 1.1% to 5.9%) and ciprofloxacin tablets (18/183, 9.8%, 95% CI 6.2% to 14.8%) obtained from 117/166 (70.5%, 95% CI 62.8 to 77.2) PDROs were tested. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics of the purchased antibiotics, and the API content of each antibiotic was compared against the United States Pharmacopeia 43-National Formulary 38 (USP 43-NF 38) standards in absolute values and percentages. RESULTS: Almost all samples produced in Indonesia (182/183, 99.5%, 95% CI 97.5% to 99.9%) were unbranded (123/183, 67.2%, 95% CI 60.2% to 73.7%) or branded generic (60/183, 32.8%, 95% CI 26.3% to 39.8%) and packaged in strips (165/183, 90.2%, 95% CI 85.2% to 93.8%). Around 12/183 (6.6%, 95% CI 3.6% to 10.8%) antibiotics were found to be OOS; these were mostly amoxicillin 125 mg dry syrup (6/12, 50%, 95% CI 24.3% to 75.7%) and ciprofloxacin 500 mg tablet (5/18, 27.8%, 95% CI 11.5% to 50.6%). Around 33% (4/12, 95% CI 12.5% to 61.2%) of amoxicillin 125 mg dry syrup samples had an API content above the label claim, the highest being 187%, whereas 16.7% (2/12, 95% CI 3.6% to 43.6%) were below the label claim, the lowest being 64%. About 27.8% (5/18, 95% CI 11.5% to 50.6%) of ciprofloxacin samples tested had an API content above the label claim; the highest was 120%. CONCLUSION: While the proportion of OOS antibiotics identified was relatively small, at a population level, it represents a significant proportion of sub-optimally treated infections.","[('upper respiratory tract infection', 'DISEASE'), ('tuberculosis', 'DISEASE'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('diarrhoea', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin dry syrup', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('syrup', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('syrup', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"
40368163,2025,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinical settings, but evidence is lacking. Considering this, we evaluated community-wide AMR in the shadow of COVID-19, using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). METHODS: 590 wastewater samples were collected from four contrasting communities in England between April 2020 and March 2022 to test for antibiotics used, their metabolites and persistent antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Catchment wide COVID-19 cases and antibiotic prescription data were triangulated with WBE data to evaluate impact of COVID-19 pandemic on changes in antibiotics use and resulting AMR at fine spatio-temporal resolution. RESULTS: Observed reduction in antibiotic consumption and AMR prevalence during COVID pandemic (especially during lockdowns) is likely due to reduced social interactions rather than due to reduced antibiotic prescribing. Population-normalised daily intake & daily prescription showed an increase of 17.2% and 5.8%, respectively in 2021-22, in comparison to the previous pandemic year. Of the 17 antibiotics targeted, amoxicillin and clarithromycin were clearly affected by COVID-19 restrictions during the year 2020-21 with an average of 31.5% (p < 0.01) and 13.5% (p < 0.05) lower usage, respectively, followed by an increase in 2021-22. This has significant implications for practice and policy that currently focusses on the reduction of antibiotics as the key risk factor in AMR. CONCLUSIONS: Better, more holistic strategies encompassing One Health philosophy are needed to understand and act upon the AMR challenge.","[('pandemic', 'DISEASE'), ('pandemic', 'DISEASE'), ('pandemic', 'DISEASE'), ('pandemic', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

A 26-year-old woman presented with left breast swelling and pain for 1 year. She was initially suspected to have a pyogenic abscess of the breast and was treated with unspecified oral antibiotics but had no clinical response. In addition, surgical drainage was done, followed by a 4-week course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. However, the swelling gradually increased in size and formed a sinus tract with a purulent discharge. Subsequently, breast tuberculosis was suspected, and a GeneXpert from the discharge was performed, which revealed rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis. She was started on anti-tuberculous medications and showed significant clinical response after 6 months of therapy. Breast tuberculosis should be considered earlier in patients with breast lesions in the absence of an alternative diagnosis and/or if the response to antibiotics is not as expected.

40365485,2025,"Cholera is a life-threatening diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae, with recurring outbreaks in Iraq, including the Kurdistan Region. Despite its endemic nature, outbreaks have primarily been reported by the health sector without comprehensive molecular epidemiological investigations. Limited studies have characterized outbreak dynamics, prevalence, and antimicrobial resistance, hindering effective public health interventions. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence, molecular characteristics, and antibiotic resistance of V. cholerae isolates from the 2023 outbreak in Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan, Iraq. A total of 1200 diarrheic stool samples were collected from Shar Hospital between July and October 2023. Bacterial isolation was performed using microbiological methods and automated VITEK 2 analysis, followed by serological identification (O1 and O139 antisera) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was conducted to assess resistance patterns. The outbreak prevalence was 0.015%, with the highest infection rate in August (0.009%). The overall infection rate was 28.91% (347/1200), with the most affected age groups being 19-33 years (27.66%) and 34-48 years (26.22%). Infection was more common in females (55.6%) than males (44.4%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed high genetic similarity to the V. cholerae Kuwait1 strain, suggesting potential introduction from southern Iraq, possibly due to an influx of tourists. Furthermore, antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that all V. cholerae isolates were susceptible to most tested antibiotics; however, complete resistance (100%) was observed against amikacin, amoxicillin, amoxiclav, nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim, with partial resistance (30%) to tetracycline. Cholera remains a major public health concern in Kurdistan, particularly in Sulaymaniyah, due to recurrent outbreaks. Molecular techniques provided crucial insights into outbreak tracking and genetic relatedness, while AST profiling highlighted the urgent need for revised treatment guidelines.

40365067,2025,"Clostridioides difficile, a major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, is increasingly resistant to antibiotics and poses a significant threat due to its regulated virulence. The alternative sigma factor sigma(54) (rpoN) is known to regulate gene expression broadly, affecting microbial adaptation. Our study investigates how rpoN influences gene expression, physiology, and virulence in C. difficile. We used a modified CRISPR-Cpf1 system to create a rpoN deletion strain (∆rpoN) and a complemented strain (::rpoN) in the CD630 background, comparing their phenotypes and transcriptomes with the wild type. The ∆rpoN strain showed reduced motility and increased susceptibility to seven antibiotics, including beta-lactams (amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefoxitin), nitroimidazoles (metronidazole), glycopeptides (vancomycin), fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin), and aminoglycosides (kanamycin). It also exhibited increased toxin gene expression, higher autolysis rates, and enhanced cytotoxicity and virulence in animal models. Additionally, rpoN deletion led to a decrease in glucose metabolic rate, which we attribute to the downregulation of glycolytic enzymes. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that reduced motility in ∆rpoN is due to downregulation of flagellar biosynthesis genes, while increased autolysis is linked to upregulation of autolysin genes like cwp19 and acd. The enhanced release of toxins due to higher autolysis rates contributes to the increased virulence of ∆rpoN. Our findings establish rpoN as a global regulator critical for antibiotic resistance, motility, metabolism, toxin production, and pathogenicity in C. difficile, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to mitigate virulence and resistance.","[('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('pseudomembranous colitis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefoxitin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitroimidazoles', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycosides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('kanamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('glucose', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Autologous platelet concentrates (APCs), including concentrated platelet-rich fibrin (c-PRF) and liquid-phase concentrated growth factors (LPCGFs), have emerged as potential carriers for antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of c-PRF and LPCGF as carriers for three antibiotic formulations-amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, clindamycin, and a combination of amoxicillin with metronidazole-against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Enterococcus faecalis (low-level natural resistance). The disk diffusion method was employed to incorporate antibiotics into both APC types, which were then applied to disks placed on bacterial cultures. The size of the inhibition zones was measured at 20-, 40-, 60-, and 80-h intervals. Every 20 h, the disks were transferred to a new Petri dish. Statistical analysis included Welch's t-test and two-way ANOVA. c-PRF demonstrated superior performance as a carrier for amoxicillin and clindamycin, showing the presence of inhibition zones for up to 60 h. In contrast, LPCGF exhibited greater efficacy when used with the amoxicillin-metronidazole combination, particularly at higher concentrations. Both APCs showed limited effectiveness against E. faecalis when combined with clindamycin. The study confirms the suitability of autologous platelet concentrates as localized antibiotic delivery systems. The choice between c-PRF and LPCGF should be guided by the drug's physicochemical properties and clinical application.

None of the pharmacies or clinics visited requested a prescription from the covert shoppers, despite the fact that all the boxes, when boxes were provided, were labeled as prescription-only medicines. Five different brands, representing 15 unique lot numbers, were collected from 31 locations. All capsules were packaged in their original blister packs, with 10.2% of those packs torn and 27.1% of the dosage forms having visible powder outside the capsule. All of the blister packs were clearly labeled with the lot number, expiry date, brand name, active pharmaceutical ingredient name, dosage, and manufacturer. The samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography according to a modified United States Pharmacopeia method. The results indicated that all samples met the standard of containing 90-120% of the stated dose of amoxicillin, with an average dosage and standard deviation of 488 mg and 25 mg, respectively.

This is particularly important as the prescribing of antibiotics in implant dentistry is becoming increasingly controversial owing to the fear of any failure due to post-operative infection; the possible litigation consequences that might emerge can be a major reason for justifying such prescription protocols. METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire-based pilot study was carried out, which assessed prescribing behaviours by UK-based dentists placing dental implants. The 11-item questionnaire sought information on implant procedures categorised as straightforward and complex implant procedures. The survey was distributed electronically through local implant study clubs and via dental social media forums. RESULTS: A total of 54 dentists responded, with almost 89% of respondents prescribing antibiotics pre-operatively and 85% prescribing antibiotics post-operatively, with amoxicillin always the primary choice. The recommended course of treatment varied between one and seven or more days. Almost half of the respondents prescribed analgesics pre- and/or post-operatively with ibuprofen and paracetamol as the first and second choices, respectively. Dexamethasone was prescribed pre- and post-operatively by 7% of the dentists. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted a lack of national antibiotics prescription guidelines and a lack of consistency in implant dentistry practice in the UK. It also indicated the need for multi-centre studies with large sample sizes that can support the foundation for appropriate guidelines on antibiotic prescribing in implant dentistry.","[('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ibuprofen', 'CHEMICAL'), ('paracetamol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Dexamethasone', 'CHEMICAL')]"

We also performed simulations to provide insights into optimising the dosing of amoxicillin against infectious bacteria in the respiratory tract. METHODS: Non-obese, obese, and post-RYGB patients, aged between 24 and 50 years, from two clinical studies, were evaluated. Sex, age, body size descriptors, history of bariatric surgery and renal function were assessed as potential covariates. The percentage of time of unbound amoxicillin plasma concentration above the minimum inhibitory concentration (%fT > MIC) of >40%, representing bactericidal activity, was used as a PK/PD target to calculate the probability of target attainment (PTA). The PTA threshold was defined as 90% of treated individuals achieving fT > MIC >/= 40%. RESULTS: Amoxicillin PK was best characterized by a one-compartment model including a zero-order absorption with lag time followed by a first-order absorption and linear elimination. The relative oral bioavailability in post-RYGB patients was nearly halved compared with non-obese subjects. Age exhibited a negative correlation with clearance, consistent with amoxicillin being a hydrophilic drug primarily eliminated through the kidneys. For MIC </= 2 mg/L, the oral dosing regimen of 1000 mg q6h reached the therapeutic target for non-obese. For MIC </= 1 mg/L, 1000 mg q6h is needed in obese and post-RYGB subjects.

This study aims to decipher the genetic map and obtain insights of clinical symptoms into Pandoraea from BSI patients. METHODS: 30 suspected BSI patients' diagnostic records and medical histories were recorded. Pandoraea spp. isolates were collected and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, Sanger sequencing and Whole-genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: Of the 30 clinical cases, five (16.67%) ultimately died, whereas 25 (83.33%) are alive. 30 purified Pandoraea isolates showed high degree of MIC values to Meropenem, Amoxicillin and Potassium Clavulanate, Gentamicin, and Ceftazidime. Then, all isolates were identified as P. pneumonica based on the 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic analysis. Among 28 genomes of them, the average genome size and average GC contents were 5,397,568 bp, and 62.43%, respectively. However, WP1 displayed high similarity (90.6%) to reference Pandoraea sp. LMG 31114. Genetic differences between the tested isolates and LMG 31114 suggested that the outbreak's causative pathogen could be a novel cluster of P. pneumonica. The genomes accumulated mutations at an estimated rate of 1.3 x 10(-7) mutations/year/site. Moreover, 26 clinical isolates within the P. pneumonica cluster were formed in July 2014, revealing a tendency to develop regional endemic patterns. CONCLUSION: BSI caused by this novel cluster of P. pneumonica is linked to significant morbidity and mortality.

40352615,2025,"Background: Oral challenges with amoxicillin or other penicillins are safe and effective for delabeling low-risk penicillin allergy histories. While approximately 90% of reported penicillin allergies can be safely delabeled, detailed data on reaction frequency, types, and timing during and after delabeling interventions remain limited. Such data are crucial to optimizing protocols and integrating oral challenges into routine practice. This study aims to characterize the interventions commonly used for oral challenge, classify reported reactions, and identify reported predictors of hypersensitivity reactions in randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies involving an oral challenge for patients with low-risk penicillin allergies. Methods: This study leverages data from a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effectiveness of oral challenge interventions in patients with low-risk penicillin allergies. This descriptive analysis summarizes the adverse reactions experienced among patients in published studies who received oral challenge. Participant demographics, intervention protocols, frequency, type, and timing of post-challenge adverse reactions are reported. Reactions are categorized as immediate, delayed, or other, with frequencies summarized using descriptive statistics. A random effects meta-analysis quantifies a pooled adverse reaction rate. Predictors of hypersensitivity reactions were synthesized narratively. Results: Across 26 studies (2 randomized trials, 24 quasi-experimental studies) evaluating an oral challenge for patients with a low-risk penicillin allergy, the average participant age was 56 years, with a predominance of females (61%) and limited ethnic diversity with 88% reported or identifying as White. Amoxicillin was the most frequenty used oral challenge agent, typically administered as a single 250 mg oral dose. The incidence of reaction or non-delabeling was 4% (95% Confidence Interval 3%, 6%), I (2) = 43%, P = .0001. Cutaneous manifestations, such as rashes, were the most frequent reactions. Delayed reactions, primarily mild maculopapular rashes, were uncommon and managed with antihistamines or topical steroids. Risk factors for oral challenge reactions included higher baseline allergy burden and shorter intervals to oral challenge since the index reaction. Conclusion: Oral challenge strategies to delabel low-risk penicillin allergies can involve single doses of amoxicillin or other penicillins with monitoring protocols that can be managed in ambulatory settings. However, although these delabeling strategies are becoming more prevalent, continued study of standardized protocols and follow-up are essential for effective and replicable delabeling strategies.

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted between April 2021 and August 2022. A total of 819 women with CE were treated with antibiotics-1 (doxycycline, n=809) or IMB (n=10, Group 1). Following endometrial biopsies, CE was not resolved in 209 out of 819 women. Subsequently, 194 patients were treated with antibiotics-1 (n=4) or -2 (amoxicillin, azithromycin, and metronidazole, n=190), whereas 15 were treated with IMB (n=15, Group 2). After the treatment with antibiotics-2, four women underwent IMB (Group 3). Statistical analysis of the number of plasma cells with CD138 before and after treatment was conducted using Fisher's exact test and p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: CE was treated in 60% of patients (6/10) in Group 1; however, the reduction in CD138 count was not statistically significant (p=0.13). In Groups 2 and 3, CE was treated with a significantly reduced CD138 count (Group 2, p<0.01; Group 3, p=0.04). CE was treated in 100% of cases in Group 2 and 3 (15/15 and 4/4, respectively). CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, administration of IMB may be effective in treating CE, especially following antibiotic treatment.","[('endometritis', 'DISEASE'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CD138', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CD138', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CD138', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40351912,2025,"Aim and objectives Acute bacterial lymphadenitis is one of the most common causes of lymphadenopathy in children, whose treatment algorithm is not well defined in literature to date. The most commonly used drug for this condition is amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. However, given escalating antibiotic resistance, the use of narrower-spectrum agents like cloxacillin could be preferred. Thus, this study was planned to compare the safety and efficacy of oral cloxacillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in pediatric bacterial lymphadenitis. Materials and methods This was a cohort analytical study done on children aged 1-14 years presenting with acute onset of lymphadenopathy. After establishing a bacterial etiology, the patients were randomized to receive either oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Group A) or cloxacillin (Group B) and followed up as per protocol. The primary outcome was the duration of defervescence from the initiation of treatment. Secondary outcomes were a reduction in lymph node size, tenderness, leukocytosis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Results A total of 192 patients were diagnosed with acute bacterial lymphadenitis and randomized into Group A (n = 99) and Group B (n = 93). Subjective and objective parameters obtained in both groups were compared before and after the initiation of treatment. The mean defervescence time for Group A was 5.92 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.15 to 6.69 days) and for Group B was 5.74 days (95% CI: 4.96 to 6.52 days). The upper bound of 95% CI in Group B (6.52) was only 0.5 days longer than the mean of Group A (5.92). This finding suggests the non-inferiority of cloxacillin in comparison with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Conclusion Oral cloxacillin is as effective and safe as compared to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in uncomplicated pediatric bacterial lymphadenitis.","[('lymphadenitis', 'DISEASE'), ('lymphadenopathy', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('narrower-spectrum', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cloxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cloxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacterial lymphadenitis', 'DISEASE'), ('lymphadenopathy', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cloxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tenderness', 'DISEASE'), ('leukocytosis', 'DISEASE'), ('lymphadenitis', 'DISEASE'), ('cloxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cloxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacterial lymphadenitis', 'DISEASE')]"
40350461,2025,"BACKGROUND: The application of wastewater-based epidemiology has gained traction as a cost effective tool in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance with studies showing a correlation between the presence of resistant bacteria from hospital sewage and patients. This study compared Klebsiella pneumoniae from patients and hospital effluent in terms of antibiotic resistance patterns, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and phylogenomic relationships. RESULTS: Pooled effluent samples were collected from the final effluent point of a regional hospital and K. pneumoniae isolates were identified on selective media. Clinical isolates were also collected from the same hospital. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed using the VITEK(R) 2 system. DNA was extracted prior to whole genome sequencing (WGS). The resistome, mobilome, and phylogenetic lineages of sequenced isolates were assessed using bioinformatics analysis. A total of 10 randomly selected presumptive and 10 clinical K. pneumoniae constituted the sample and were subjected to AST. Total resistance was observed in the clinical samples to cefuroxime, cefotaxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, gentamicin, tobramycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The effluent isolates exhibited total susceptibility to most antibiotics but showed resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam (100%), and tigecycline (10%). The effluent isolates did not exhibit a diverse resistome, while the clinical isolates harboured genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside (aph(6)-Id, aph(3'')-Ib, aac(6')-Ib-cr, aadA16), ss-lactam (bla(SVH) group, bla(OXA) group, bla(TEM) group), and fluoroquinolone (oqxA, oqxB) antibiotics. Only class 1 integrons were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that effluent isolates from this study were not closely related to the clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: This study showed no correlation between the resistance profiles of the clinical and effluent isolates. The relationship between AMR in hospital effluent and clinical resistance may depend on the antimicrobial agents and bacterial species studied.","[('pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('piperacillin/tazobactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tobramycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('piperacillin/tazobactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tigecycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycoside', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aph(6)-Id', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ss-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolone', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Recommended treatment differs for sporadic versus recurrent infections. Antimicrobial selection is ideally informed by local antibiograms; however, this data is currently unavailable for dogs and cats in Sydney, Australia's largest city by population. The objectives of this retrospective study were to: i) identify the proportions of bacterial species in positive cultures from canine and feline urine samples submitted between 2012 and 2021 to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Sydney, Australia, ii) describe and compare antimicrobial susceptibility profiles between isolates from sporadic and recurrent positive cultures and iii) develop local antibiograms to facilitate evidence-based decisions around empiric therapy. A total of 1506 positive urine cultures were obtained from 567 dogs and 471 cats. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (58 %), Enterococcus spp. (17 %), Staphylococcus spp. (13.4 %) and Proteus spp. (9 %). Eighty-three percent of bacterial isolates were susceptible to at least one first-line empirical choice (amoxicillin and/or trimethoprim-sulfonamide). E. coli had the highest percentage of multidrug-resistant isolates from animals with sporadic (32 %) and recurrent positive cultures (40 %). Susceptibility of E. coli to amoxicillin increased from 47 % in 2012 to 55 % in 2021.

DESIGN: Secondary analysis-multicentre, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial. SETTINGS AND PATIENTS: 324 children aged 3 months to </=5 years hospitalised with radiographic-confirmed CAP were enrolled from seven hospitals in Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia. After 1-3 days of intravenous antibiotics, then 3 days of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, they were randomised to extended (13-14 days) or standard (5-6 days) courses of antibiotics. INTERVENTION: CXRs were performed at admission, 4 weeks, and 12 months post-discharge and reviewed in a blinded manner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiographic changes of pneumonia at 4 weeks and 12 months post-discharge compared with admission CXRs. RESULTS: Among children with interpretable CXRs, incomplete resolution was seen in 42/253 (17%) at 4 weeks, and 29/212 (14%) at 12 months. Characteristics at admission associated with incomplete CXR resolution at 4 weeks were previous pneumonia hospitalisation (adjusted odds ratio [OR(adj)])=6.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.21 to 18.85) and increasing age (OR(adj)=0.60 per-year, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94). Continuing respiratory symptoms/signs at 4 weeks post-discharge was also associated with incomplete resolution (OR=5.63, 95% CI 2.38 to 13.32). At 12 months, previous pneumonia hospitalisation was associated with persistent incomplete CXR resolution (OR=4.03, 95 % CI 1.25 to 13.02). CONCLUSION: In high-risk settings, younger age, those with previous pneumonia hospitalisation, or ongoing respiratory symptoms/signs 4 weeks post-discharge from hospitalised CAP may be associated with incomplete CXR resolution. Consequently, follow-up imaging and monitoring may be warranted in these children.","[('community-acquired pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('CAP', 'CHEMICAL'), ('respiratory sequelae', 'DISEASE'), ('radiographic-confirmed CAP', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('CAP', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Here, we characterized the genome of multidrug-resistant H. pylori strains of novel sequence types, which were recovered from Vietnamese patients with gastritis or a stomach ulcer. Phenotypic-antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed against amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazol, tetracycline, and levofloxacin using an E-test. The whole genome sequence of three H. pylori strains was de novo assembled, followed by in silico analysis of multilocus sequence typing (MLST), core-genome based phylogeny, genetic determinants associated with virulence, biofilm formation, and antibiotic-resistance. The genome sequence of H. pylori strains exhibited a high similarity with the average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of 98.5% to 99.2%, carried 5 to 7 pathogenicity islands, and 3 to 6 mobilomes. The MLST profile of strains revealed novel sequence types ST4511, ST4512, and ST4513. Core-genome based phylogeny exhibited that the three H. pylori strains belong to the Asian genotype. These strains possessed 128 to 131 virulence genes, including toxin-encoding genes cagA and vacA. Double amoxicillin-resistant mutations on pbp1 and pbp2, or a mutation on pbp3, triple clarithromycin-resistant mutations on 23S rRNA gene and a levofloxacin-resistant mutation on gyrA were detected in antibiotic-resistant strains. Mutations on rdxA were detected in both metronidazole-resistant and -sensitive strains, whereas frxA mutations were detected in only one metronidazole-sensitive strain.

40334445,2025,"BACKGROUND: Kimura disease (KD) is a benign, chronic inflammatory disorder first described by Kimm and Szeto in 1937, with further details provided by Kimura in 1948. It typically presents as unilateral subcutaneous masses in the head and neck, particularly post-auricular, affecting lymph nodes, soft tissues, and salivary glands. The aetiology is uncertain but may involve hypersensitivity or immune responses. Diagnosis relies on histological examination showing eosinophilic infiltration and lymphocyte proliferation. The exact cause remains unclear, though hypersensitivity or immune mechanisms have been suggested. KD is extremely rare in the inguinal region, and awareness of such atypical presentations is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an elderly woman who presented with a painless, slow-growing inguinal mass. Clinical and radiological evaluations suggested a benign lesion, but malignancy could not be ruled out. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Kimura disease, revealing characteristic eosinophilic infiltration and lymphoid proliferation. The patient underwent surgical excision followed by corticosteroid therapy. She recovered well and remained asymptomatic during an 18-month follow-up period. DISCUSSION: Kimura disease predominantly affects young Asian men, with very few reported cases in elderly women or in the inguinal region. It can mimic malignant or infectious conditions, making histopathological confirmation essential. Imaging aids in ruling out other differential diagnoses, but biopsy remains the gold standard. Treatment options include surgical excision, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive therapy. Our case emphasizes the importance of considering KD in unusual locations and patient demographics. CONCLUSION: This case underscores the need for awareness of atypical presentations of Kimura disease. Early recognition and appropriate management can prevent unnecessary interventions and misdiagnosis. Surgical excision combined with corticosteroid therapy was effective, leading to an uneventful recovery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Chinese woman with underlying hypertension and ischemic heart disease (on clopidogrel 75 mg daily) presented with a painless lump over the right inguinal region, which had appeared three months prior. The swelling was intermittent without discharge, fever, weight loss, or systemic symptoms. She had no history of malignancy, tuberculosis, recent infections, or trauma. Examination revealed a 2 x 2 cm, firm, mobile, non-tender swelling over the right inguinal region. No other lymph nodes were palpable. A two-week course of empirical antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate 625 mg TID) resulted in temporary resolution, but the swelling recurred a month later. Ultrasound revealed an enlarged lymph node with preserved architecture, while CT abdomen and pelvis showed non-necrotic lymphadenopathy without hepatosplenomegaly. Serum IgE was elevated at 1200 IU/mL. No other lymphadenopathy was detected in the neck, axilla, or other catchment areas. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was inconclusive, leading to surgical excision of three lymph nodes. Histopathological examination confirmed Kimura disease, showing follicular hyperplasia with eosinophilic infiltration and vascular proliferation. Postoperatively, she received oral prednisolone (30 mg daily for 4 weeks, tapered over 3 months). At the 18-month follow-up, she remained asymptomatic without recurrence.","[('Kimura disease', 'DISEASE'), ('hypersensitivity', 'DISEASE'), ('hypersensitivity', 'DISEASE'), ('malignancy', 'DISEASE'), ('Kimura disease', 'DISEASE'), ('Kimura disease', 'DISEASE'), ('hypertension', 'DISEASE'), ('clopidogrel', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swelling', 'DISEASE'), ('fever', 'DISEASE'), ('weight loss', 'DISEASE'), ('malignancy', 'DISEASE'), ('tuberculosis', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('trauma', 'DISEASE'), ('swelling', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swelling', 'DISEASE'), ('lymphadenopathy', 'DISEASE'), ('hepatosplenomegaly', 'DISEASE'), ('lymphadenopathy', 'DISEASE'), ('follicular hyperplasia', 'DISEASE'), ('prednisolone', 'CHEMICAL')]"

This study aimed to assess the occurrence and antibiotic resistance patterns of E. coli in SA patients in Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2021 to December 2023. 220 samples were collected from SA patients from tertiary care hospitals. Joint aspirates (2ml) and blood (5ml) were analyzed for microbial and hematological examination. RESULTS: There were 5.45% samples positive, and 94.5% negative for E. coli. SA due to E. coli was more common in male (6.2%) than female (4.6%) patients with the knee being the most affected joint (6.3%). E. coli was more common in patients aged 41-60 years (7.7%), lower socioeconomic (6.9%), and illiterate (8.6%) patients. Suspected patients showed a significant increase in the levels of white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), notably, these levels were further elevated in E. coli-positive patients. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based identification of E. coli showed clear bands of 204bp of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequence analysis using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool found high similarity with pathogenic E. coli from Egypt and China. The identified E. coli strain showed significant resistance to common antibiotics: amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, gentamicin, tetracycline, and erythromycin.

After a continuous 5-week antimicrobial therapy, the patient was urgently transferred back from cardiological rehabilitation to the hospital due to acute flank pain with emesis.Clinically, the 64-year-old patient presented with tenderness in the right abdomen. Laboratory tests revealed acute kidney injury AKI 3 with microhematuria in the urine analysis. Sonographically, there was evidence of hydronephrosis in the right kidney. An abdominal CT revealed a calculus in the urinary bladder.The calculus, measuring 7 x 3 x 2 mm, was expelled through micturition and consisted 100% of amoxicillin. Therefore, the diagnosis of amoxicillin-induced urolithiasis was made.The antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin was adjusted according to kidney function. Due to an initially unclear inflammatory condition associated with Dressler syndrome, the combination therapy was completed after 8 weeks instead of 6 weeks. At this time, the creatinine level was slightly elevated. After two weeks, it was back within the normal range. Two years later, the patient is free from recurrence of endocarditis.In the case of intrarenal precipitation of crystals, crystal nephropathy occurs, which presents a rare side effect of amoxicillin. As in this case, massive precipitation of macroscopic crystals in the renal pelvis can even lead to urolithiasis with obstructive nephropathy. This case demonstrates the importance of regular monitoring of renal function during treatment with amoxicillin, particularly in high-dose therapy with prolonged treatment duration.","[('febrile', 'DISEASE'), ('faecalis endocarditis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('acute kidney injury KDIGO stadium AKI', 'DISEASE'), ('pain', 'DISEASE'), ('emesis', 'DISEASE'), ('tenderness', 'DISEASE'), ('acute kidney injury AKI 3', 'DISEASE'), ('microhematuria', 'DISEASE'), ('hydronephrosis', 'DISEASE'), ('calculus', 'DISEASE'), ('calculus', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-induced urolithiasis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Dressler syndrome', 'DISEASE'), ('creatinine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('endocarditis', 'DISEASE'), ('nephropathy', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('urolithiasis', 'DISEASE'), ('obstructive nephropathy', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('high-dose', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40324828,2025,"OBJECTIVES: The analysis of prescriptions plays a crucial role in promoting rational drug use, minimizing medication errors, and enabling effective antimicrobial surveillance. Manual analyzing is time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. This study aimed to evaluate prescribing patterns and antimicrobial surveillance using a novel digital analytical platform in a tertiary care hospital. METHODOLOGY: A descriptive observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital, in India, between June and August 2024. Prescription data were collected from outpatient departments (general medicine, surgery, pediatrics, pulmonology, and orthopedics) and analyzed using the VaidyaRx digital analytic platform. World Health Organization Core Prescribing Indicators were applied to assess prescribing trends, generic drug usage, antibiotic prescribing patterns, fixed-dose combination (FDC), and adherence to the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). Data were analyzed using MS Excel and VaidyaRx. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 35.8 +/- 19.2 years, with pediatrics (21.8%), adult (73.3%), and geriatric (4.9%). The average drugs per prescription were 3.2, and generic prescriptions were 37.5%. Antibiotics were prescribed in 24.9% of prescriptions, highest in surgery (46.9%), with ofloxacin + ornidazole and amoxicillin + potassium clavulanate being the most common. NLEM drug use was 36.7%, with more FDCs from non-NLEM (40.9%) than NLEM (8.3%) drugs. Only 64.5% of prescriptions mentioned dosage, raising concerns about completeness. CONCLUSIONS: Using the VaidyaRx digital platform, real-time prescription analysis was possible which helped in enhancing medication safety and antimicrobial stewardship. Suitable interventions are needed to reduce polypharmacy, increase generic prescribing, ensure rational antibiotic use, and improve prescribing practices.","[('ofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ornidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('potassium clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL')]"

40320022,2025,"Amoxicillin is one of the most prescribed antibiotics in the paediatric population. Currently available formulations (i.e., suspensions and tablets) suffer from limited acceptability often responsible for the therapeutic failure. In the present study it is proposed an innovative formulation for amoxicillin oral administration that could meet acceptability requirements of the paediatric population. Chewable gummy tablets were produced by the Pressure-Assisted Microsyringe 3D printing technology. As ""ink"" it was used a gel obtained by the co-formulation of corn starch with acacia honey. The optimized formulation, having a final dose of 200 mg per unit, resulted visually appealing. Good accuracy between the computer-aided design and final 3D-printed product was evident as well. The fabricated gummy tablets (1.07 +/- 0.05 g) showed acceptable mechanical properties such as hardness (150.52 +/- 5.67 N), and gumminess (68.13 +/- 6.51 N) when exposed to simulated salivary fluid. Moreover, the 3D-printed gummy tablets determined the almost complete release of the drug in the gastric environment within 2 h and assured its permeation through the PermeaPad(R) membranes. The obtained results suggest that 3D printing is a versatile and scalable technology useful in the pharmaceutical industry to fabricate customized chewable formulations as a suitable alternative to conventional formulations for amoxicillin administration in the paediatric population.","[('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hardness', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

40312324,2025,"The aim of this study was to identify genetic factors responsible for antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that can cause long-term gastroduodenal disease. The primary resistance of H. pylori to commonly used antibiotics was studied, and high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) was employed to discover genetic determinants of resistance using a reference-based approach. A total of 123 H. pylori strains were cultured and tested for antibiotic susceptibility using an E test. Genotypic analysis was performed using NGS data with ARIBA v2.14.7 and PlasmidSeeker v1.3 for plasmid detection. Statistical correlations between resistant genotypes and phenotypes were evaluated. In addition, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and linear mixed model were used to identify genetic variants associated with antimicrobial resistance phenotypes while adjusting for covariates such as population structure. Our results showed that 78.2% of the strains were resistant to metronidazole (MTZ), 22.5% to levofloxacin (LVX), 43.5% to clarithromycin (CLR) and 13.7% to amoxicillin (AMX). Resistance to tetracycline was not detected. Multi-drug resistance was detected in 48.8% of the strains. While plasmids were not detected, chromosomal genetic determinants of resistance to CLR, LVX, and AMX were identified, including mutations in 23S rRNA (A2142G and A2143G), gyrA (N87K/Y and D91Y/N/G), and pbp1 A (F366L, S414R, F473V, G595_V596insE, as well as the mutations T558S and T593A/G/P/S). Additionally, missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations in rdxA were identified as genetic determinants of resistance to MTZ. No genetic determinants associated with tetracycline resistance were detected. A strong correlation was observed between resistance genotypes and phenotypes for CLR, LVX, AMX, and MTZ. In addition, we found that missense, frameshift and nonsense mutations in rdxA were genetic determinants of resistance to MTZ. We did not detect any genetic determinants associated with tetracycline resistance. There was a strong correlation between resistance genotypes and phenotypes for CLR, LVX, AMX, and MTZ. Furthermore, unitig-based GWAS revealed that AMX, LVX, and CLR resistance in H. pylori was mainly caused by chromosomal mutations that affected the targets of these antibiotics (pbp1 A, gyrA, and 23S rRNA, respectively). Our results highlight the need for regular evaluation and alternative therapies in Vietnam, given the high rates of H. pylori resistance to CLR, MTZ, and LVX.

This study aims to explore the effect of different concentrations of amoxicillin-clavulanate, the most commonly used antibiotic in pediatrics, on the biofilm formation of Haemophilus influenza (H. influenzae) in vitro and to explore the underlying mechanisms. The effect of amoxicillin-clavulanate on the in vitro biofilm formation was assessed by crystal violet assay, colony counts, MTT colorimetric method, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses were performed to identify key genes and metabolites. Our findings revealed that 1/2 MIC of amoxicillin-clavulanate significantly enhanced H. influenzae ATCC 49247 biofilm formation in vitro, while simultaneously reducing culturable bacterial counts and metabolic activity of biofilm-embedded bacteria. When exposed to 1/2 MIC of amoxicillin-clavulanate, the biofilm ultrastructure was altered, with an increase in biofilm structure, a decrease in bacteria embedded within the biofilms with abnormal bacterial morphology. Transcriptomics identified 118 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), comprising 62 upregulated and 56 downregulated genes. Metabolomics identified 21 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs), with 13 upregulated and 8 downregulated. Integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics implicated amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism as a key regulatory pathway.

Hence, it is imperative to develop effective remediation technologies for the targeted treatment of antibiotic pollution to mitigate its environmental and health risks. This paper reviews the status of antibiotic pollution in major countries, territories, and regions worldwide. Addressing the risks cause by antibiotics and their resistance genes and achieving efficient remediation of antibiotic pollutants. Additionally, the study explores the issue of antibiotic use and resistance in detail from a global perspective. It provides a critical scientific foundation for controlling global antibiotic resistance through multi-dimensional integrated analysis. In 2021, 4.71 million deaths globally were attributed to antibiotic resistance, with countries such as India and China being the most affected. It also examined the predominant types and sources of antibiotic pollutants, as well as key remediation technologies for addressing antibiotic contamination. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin are commonly found in surface waters at concentrations ranging from 1 to 120 mug L(-1). Furthermore, this paper highlighted the distinctive advantages of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in addressing antibiotic pollution, demonstrating removal efficiencies exceeding 90 % under optimal conditions. Our review underscored the pivotal role of iron-based materials and porous biochar in AOPs, showing promising results in various environmental settings. Future research should prioritize the development of multifunctional iron-based composites with improved catalytic stability, environmental compatibility, and recyclability.

40304423,2025,"Barrier membranes are essential components of tissue regenerative therapies, acting as physical barriers to protect the healing site. Although collagen-based membranes are widely used, they degrade enzymatically, often triggering inflammation and cytotoxicity arising from residual cross-linking agents. Synthetic polymer-based membranes, such as polydioxanone (PDO), present customizable properties, predictable degradation rates, and induce bone formation more effectively. However, both materials are at risk of exposure to the microbial contamination. To address this, antibiotics have been loaded onto membranes as drug-delivery systems, a strategy that has not yet been explored for PDO membranes. In this study, the oral polymicrobial contamination of PDO-based membranes was evaluated and compared with collagen membranes and aimed to develop an amoxicillin-loaded PDO (AMX-PDO) membrane. For this purpose, PDO membranes with different pore sizes (0.25, 0.50, and 1.00 mm) and two commercially available collagen membranes were evaluated, using in vitro and in situ models, in terms of polymicrobial accumulation. Next, AMX-PDO membranes were developed by glow discharge plasma using Ar and O(2) gases and an amoxicillin compound. The findings revealed similar microbial levels for both PDO and collagen-based membranes, but PDO membranes modulated microbial composition with reduced ( approximately 3-5 fold-decrease) levels of specific oral pathogens. The AMX-PDO membrane maintained similar physical and chemical properties to those of untreated membranes, but it significantly reduced polymicrobial accumulation and prevented microbial cells from passing through them. Thus, they acted as more than passive physical barriers only, but rather as biologically active barriers. Therefore, amoxicillin loading on PDO barrier membranes by means of plasma technology seems to be a promising strategy to prevent local infection during regenerative therapy.","[('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('polymicrobial', 'DISEASE'), ('polymicrobial', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('PDO', 'DISEASE'), ('polymicrobial', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE')]"

Therefore, this study aimed to conduct the first systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical Enterobacterales resistance to 11 representative antimicrobials from the WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) list, and to provide recommendations to tackle AMR more efficiently in Togo. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (The PRISMA 2020) were used to conduct this study and the protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024606897). Keywords were used to conduct a systematic literature review of electronic databases. Data analysis was conducted using Stata software version 17.0. RESULTS: Twenty research articles reporting 9,327 clinical Enterobacterales isolates obtained from 1991 to 2020 were included in this review and were mainly Escherichia coli (6,639; 71.2%), and Klebsiella spp. (2,542; 27.3%), mainly isolated from urine (14 studies; 70%), and pus/wounds (12; 60%). The pooled Enterobacterales resistance rates ranged from 1% (95% CI: 0, 2) imipenem, 3% (95% CI: 1, 5) amikacin, 4% (95% CI: 2, 7) fosfomycin, 50% (95% CI: 40, 60) chloramphenicol, 55% (95% CI: 45, 64) gentamicin, 68% (95% CI: 59, 76) ciprofloxacin, 73% (95% CI: 66, 80) amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC), 79% (95% CI: 71, 86) third-generation cephalosporins (3GC), to 90% (95% CI: 86, 93) sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT). The most significant upward trend over 30 years was reported for SXT (R(2) = 73.24%, p < 0.001), ciprofloxacin (R(2) = 61.44%, p < 0.001), and 3GC (R(2) = 18.49%, p < 0.001). Klebsiella spp. strains were significantly more resistant to chloramphenicol (p = 0.03) than E. coli isolates, whereas E. coli isolates were significantly more resistant to amikacin (p = 0.04) than Klebsiella spp. isolates. CONCLUSION: This study revealed high first-line AMR rates with drastic upward trends in clinical Enterobacterales isolated in Togo over the past 30 years. Thus, the adjustment of empirical antimicrobial treatments in Togo becomes crucial.

40298585,2025,"Background/Objectives: Antibiotic resistance is a serious public health problem threatening the treatment of infectious diseases caused by Escherichia coli, the main source of food contamination and responsible for many infectious diseases with high indices of AR profiles. Our objective was to study the presence of Escherichia coli in foods that are distributed and prepared on the street, characterizing its sensitivity profile and resistance to antibiotic drugs commonly prescribed in this geographical area. Methods: Standard procedures were performed to identify and isolate E. coli colonies from food samples collected during a three-year study. Susceptibility assays were conducted to determine the antibiotic resistance profile, and Colony PCR assays were performed to determine the pathogenic and antibiotic resistance genes. Results: A total of 189 food samples were collected, and 100% of the samples were positive for E. coli, with higher percentages of contamination for vegetables and fruits. ETEC (lt) and UPEC (vat, cnf1, hylA) genes were identified in 100% of the samples and DAEC (afa) in 27%. E. coli exhibited high percentages of resistance against ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (100%) and cephalexin (45%). The most effective antibiotics were tetracycline, TMP-SMX, polymyxin, and quinolones. The AR genes tetA, sul1, catA1, strA, qnrS, and floR were identified among the samples. Conclusions: Food prepared and marketed on the streets seriously threatens human health. Ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid should not be used to treat infections caused by the multidrug-resistant ETEC and UPEC identified in this area. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the status of AR in this geographical area.","[('infectious diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('infectious diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalexin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TMP-SMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polymyxin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('quinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('qnrS', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"
40298583,2025,"Background/Objectives: Since 28 January 2022, veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) must be used in accordance with the conditions of the marketing authorisation (Regulation (EU) 2019/6, Article 106). This entails further restrictions on therapeutic freedom, for example, with regard to dose deviations. Off-label use is any use of a product that deviates from the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPCs). To date, there are no data available on the type and extent of off-label use on the basis of which the feasibility of the new regulation in Germany can be assessed. Methods: Therefore, a Germany-wide anonymous online survey was conducted as a quantitative cross-sectional study comprising 196 questions according to off-label use in dogs and cats. Results: In quantitative terms, the survey was representative of 358 participants but limited due to the demographic characteristics of the participants. A total of 91.3% (326/357) veterinarians stated that they had used antibiotics off-label. Fusidic acid, chloramphenicol, tylosin, and florfenicol were most frequently reclassified with regard to animal species. Authorised drugs for cats and dogs such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, doxycycline, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolones, like enrofloxacin and marbofloxacin, were also used off-label, often with regard to indication and treatment duration. Conclusions: Although there are comparatively many antibacterial preparations available for cats and dogs, off-label use is common practice. In many cases, special circumstances of the individual case justify the off-label use of authorised preparations for cats and dogs. The survey results indicate that some dose revisions are recommended. Guidance for specific indications in cats and dogs could contribute to greater legal certainty in small animal practice with regard to the justification of off-label use.","[('VMPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chloramphenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tylosin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('florfenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('enrofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('marbofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40298578,2025,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant disruptions in healthcare services worldwide, including dental care, resulting in increased reliance on antibiotics as a substitute for in-person dental interventions. Aim: This study aimed to examine the prescription of different classes of antibiotics at the University Dental Clinical Center of Kosovo during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it with prescription trends from the pre-pandemic period. Methodology: This study analyzed antibiotic prescription patterns at the University Dental Clinical Center of Kosovo (UCDCK) from 2019 to 2022, focusing on dental patients. Data were collected using a standardized form and a review of electronic health records. Descriptive statistics were used to examine trends, which were compared to data from other countries facing similar healthcare disruptions. The data is organized into quartiles, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the distribution and trends in antibiotic usage over the four-year period. Results: The study revealed a significant increase in the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, clindamycin, and metronidazole, during the pandemic period. Data collected from the university dentistry center showed that the highest frequency of antibiotic prescriptions occurred in 2021 (27.6%), while the lowest was in 2022 (22.8%). Metronidazole (39.4%) and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (38.5%) were the most frequently prescribed antibiotics, together accounting for the majority of prescriptions. Amoxicillin alone represented 18.2%, with other antibiotics prescribed at significantly lower rates. These findings highlight the reliance on these antibiotics for dental treatments and underscore the importance of monitoring prescription trends to optimize usage and minimize resistance risks. Conclusions: The study highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental antibiotic prescription practices in Kosovo, revealing a concerning increase in broad-spectrum antibiotic use.

40298569,2025,"Background: The global spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains one of the greatest challenges of our time, necessitating collaboration among professionals in both the animal and public health sectors. One bacterial species that is developing AMR is Clostridium perfringens. It causes serious bacterial infections and continues to cause significant economic losses in the poultry industry. Methods: This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of commensal C. perfringens strains isolated from large-scale turkey flocks in Hungary using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. We complemented our research with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to detect the major and minor toxin genes that are characteristic of the species and to explore the potential associations between gene presence and antimicrobial resistance profiles. Results: A total of 146 commensal isolates were examined. Sensitivity to penicillin was reduced, with only 44.5% of isolates remaining susceptible, whereas 87.7% of isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin. The PCR results revealed that all isolates carried the alpha major toxin gene, 23.9% harbored the beta major toxin gene, 15.8% the beta2 minor toxin gene, 3.4% the NetB minor toxin gene, and 2.7% the epsilon major toxin gene. No statistically significant associations were observed between the presence of toxin genes and the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the isolates; the MIC values showed no correlation with the presence of toxin-producing genes. Conclusions:Clostridium perfringens isolates retained susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics, which remain the primary choice for treatment. Regular monitoring can aid in establishing temporal trends. Future studies should include larger sample sizes and employ next-generation sequencing to further investigate multidrug-resistant strains.","[('Clostridium perfringens', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NetB', 'DISEASE'), ('Clostridium perfringens', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40298558,2025,"Background: Exposure to antimicrobials and Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are modifiable risk factors for nosocomial Clostridiodes difficile infection (CDI). We investigated the association between these agents and nosocomial CDI over five years. Methods: Nosocomial CDI from January 2017 to December 2021 were included. Consumption trends were analyzed using a simple linear regression model. A correlation analysis was performed using Spearman's test in two ways: without a time interval and with 1-month interval matching. An interrupted time-series method to evaluate the impact of three key temporal breakpoints on CDI incidence rate was performed using the Poisson regression model. Results: A downward trend for cephalexin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, gentamicin, macrolides, metronidazole, and penicillin sodium was identified. In contrast, an upward trend was recognized for amoxicillin, ceftazidime/avibactam, ertapenem, fluconazole, ketoconazole, levofloxacin, and tigecycline. Among the antimicrobials that showed a positive association between consumption and the incidence of CDI are clindamycin and cephalosporins after immediate consumption. Moreover, macrolides and metronidazole presented a positive correlation, in both immediate and delayed consumption. PPIs consumption did not show changes and was not associated with nosocomial CDI incidence. The interrupted time series analysis showed no changes at the breakpoints selected. Conclusions: Consumption of clindamycin, cephalosporins, and macrolides showed positive association with CDI, despite having a downtrend in consumption. Specific events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of ASP, have had no correlation with CDI.

40298525,2025,"Background: Amoxicillin (AMOX) is widely used in aquaculture for bacterial infections due to its efficacy and safety. Despite official approval for select species, off-label use is common. This study evaluated the antibacterial efficacy and residue depletion of AMOX in five aquaculture species: olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii), and Israeli carp (Cyprinus carpio). Methods: Fish were administered AMOX orally at 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg for seven days. Antibacterial efficacy was assessed by bacterial load reduction and survival rates following artificial infection. Residue depletion was analyzed using HPLC-MS/MS to determine the time required for AMOX levels to fall below the maximum residue limit (MRL, 0.05 mg/kg). Results: AMOX, at 40 mg/kg, significantly reduced bacterial loads in olive flounder, rainbow trout, and Japanese eel (p < 0.05), while Israeli carp exhibited a limited response (p = 0.54). Black rockfish showed moderate efficacy (RPS 72.7%) but increased mortality at 80 mg/kg. Residue levels fell below the MRL within 10 days for all species except Israeli carp (~30 days). Conclusions: These findings highlight species-specific differences in AMOX efficacy and residue depletion rates, emphasizing the necessity of tailored dosing regimens and withdrawal periods to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes and food safety compliance in aquaculture. Further pharmacokinetic studies are needed to refine dosing strategies, particularly for species with extended residue retention and potential dose-dependent adverse effects.","[('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMOX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE'), ('AMOX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMOX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('AMOX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMOX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMOX', 'CHEMICAL')]"

40298501,2025,"Background: Laying hens, which are widely utilized for consumption and export in various regions, experience prolonged antibiotic exposure due to their longer lifespan, increasing the risk of antibiotic resistance and impacting the microbial environment of poultry slaughterhouses. Given the significance of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli in food safety, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of ESBL genes in E. coli isolated from a laying hen slaughterhouse in Konya, Turkey. Methods: Sampling was conducted using a convenient sampling approach, and a total of 150 samples were collected from a single slaughterhouse over six visits during both warm (June-August) and cold (January-March) seasons to evaluate seasonal variations. Samples were categorized into environmental sources (personnel, air, wastewater, eggs) and carcass-related sources (cloaca, carcasses at critical control points, final product). Classical cultural and molecular techniques and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were used for ESBL presence and gene characterization. For sequence analysis, the bidirectional Sanger Gene sequence analysis method was applied. Results: PCR-based detection identified 10 of the 17 isolates as E. coli by amplifying the uspA gene, and bidirectional Sanger sequencing further confirmed these isolates at the species level. The E. coli isolates were detected at various sampling areas, including personnel, carcasses after evisceration, and raw wastewater samples collected at different time points. In the multiplex PCR analysis, most ESBL isolates were positive for the blaCTX-M gene. The co-existence of blaTEM and blaCTX-M genes was detected in five samples. Additionally, three genes (blaSHV, blaCTX-M, and blaOXA) were identified in a carcass sample after evisceration. All ESBL-producing isolates harbored the blaCTX-M1 gene, and multiple antibiotic resistance was observed across all isolates. The presence of these genes was strongly associated with resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, aztreonam, cefepime, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, and cephalothin, highlighting the critical role of blaCTX-M in driving the multidrug resistance patterns observed in this study. The highest resistance rate (80%) was observed in ""personnel"" and ""carcass samples after evisceration"", while all isolates remained sensitive to carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem).

Antibiotic therapy can be prescribed for the treatment of diffuse dental or oral cavity infections, always as a complement to the most suitable dental procedure for the specific case. The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge regarding the use and prescribing practices of antibiotics in pediatric patients in a sample of Italian dentists by using an anonymous and telematic questionnaire. METHODS: A specially prepared questionnaire was electronically transmitted to a cohort of Italian dentists. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: demographic information and general knowledge of antibiotic prescription in pediatric dentistry. The statistical analysis of the obtained data was performed. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 242 Italian dentists. Poor statistically significant differences emerged between specialists in Pediatric Dentistry and dentists without specialization or specialists in other branches, as well as between dentists who, in their clinical activity, mainly treat children/adolescents or adults. For the complementary treatment of dental or oral cavity infections, Amoxicillin was the antibiotic indicated as the first choice for pediatric patients with no allergy to penicillins by most of the sample, while more than 20% of dentists would prescribe Clindamycin in patients with an allergy to penicillin.

40298482,2025,"BACKGROUND: The global spread of antimicrobial resistance is one of the defining challenges of our time. Preserving the efficacy of antibiotics is a shared responsibility, which includes conducting regular surveillance studies. The poultry industry, which produces the highest quantity of animal-derived protein in the shortest time, faces significant challenges from Escherichia coli, a bacterium frequently responsible for clinical disease. METHODS: This study aimed to assess the susceptibility of E. coli isolates collected from clinical cases in turkeys across Hungary to antibiotics of veterinary and public health importance using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. RESULTS: Over the course of one year, we analyzed a total of 70 clinical isolates. Most isolates (64.3%) were resistant to amoxicillin, and the observed 25.7% resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid suggests that the majority of strains are beta-lactamase producers. The highest resistance level was observed against neomycin (74.3%). Resistance to critically important antibiotics, including enrofloxacin (28.6%), ceftriaxone (8.6%), and colistin (7.1%) raises significant public health concerns. When comparing our results with human hospital resistance data from Hungary, most findings showed comparable values, with the exception of neomycin, which exhibited markedly higher resistance in the isolates from poultry. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the necessity of regular surveillance studies, which should be periodically repeated in the future to observe temporal trends. These results should also be linked to antibiotic usage patterns, and the genetic background of multidrug-resistant strains should be further examined using next-generation sequencing techniques.

40298473,2025,"Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a serious global challenge in the 21st century. Poultry, including turkeys, are a vital source of animal-derived protein worldwide. Commensal bacterial strains in poultry can act as reservoirs for AMR, making monitoring them crucial for both veterinary and public health. Enterococcus species are emerging pathogens, particularly in severe nosocomial infections. Methods: This study aimed to assess the resistance profiles of commensal Enterococcus strains isolated (n = 470) from large-scale turkey flocks in Hungary. From each animal, two swab samples were collected: one from the oropharyngeal region near the tracheal entrance and one from the cloaca. The samples were subsequently processed, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The tested antibiotics included amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, imipenem, neomycin, doxycycline, florfenicol, tylosin, enrofloxacin, potentiated sulfonamide, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, tiamulin, lincomycin, and colistin. The dilution range for MIC determination was set between 512 and 0.001 microg/mL. Results: Resistance to amoxicillin, a first-line treatment for Enterococcus infections, was low (11.1%). However, high resistance levels were observed for tylosin (62.6%), florfenicol (51.1%), doxycycline (48.7%), and enrofloxacin (45.5%). Notably, vancomycin resistance reached 15.5%, a finding consistent with global trends. Compared to human-derived Enterococcus data, resistance to aminopenicillins was significantly lower in turkey isolates, while neomycin resistance levels were comparable to those observed in human E. faecalis strains. Conclusions: The findings underscore the necessity of continuous surveillance of AMR trends in poultry production. While amoxicillin remains an effective treatment, the presence of multidrug-resistant strains and vancomycin-resistant isolates raises concerns regarding the potential dissemination of resistance genes. Future studies should incorporate next-generation sequencing to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying resistance.

Diabetes prevalence in the HL group was 10.6%-12.3%, compared with 4.4%-5.9% among the controls. The use of proton pump inhibitor components increased, particularly esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate and rabeprazole sodium, whereas the usage of pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate and revaprazan was high initially but declined subsequently. The usage of painkillers such as acetaminophen, loxoprofen sodium, and ibuprofen remained high, and antibiotics such as cephalosporins indicated the highest usage. However, the use of penicillin antibiotics such as amoxicillin decreased significantly. Anticancer agents showed relatively low usage compared with other drug categories, whereas antihistamines showed extremely high usage across all years, with a continual increase.

40296337,2025,"BACKGROUND Brodie's abscess is a subacute osteomyelitis, most often seen in the long bones of children. In the emergency department (ED) these patients usually present with prolonged atraumatic limb pain and no signs of systemic infection. There is usually no known triggering factor for this infection. We describe a case of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis resulting in Brodie's abscess, which has not been reported previously. CASE REPORT A 6-year-old boy with 4 days of sore throat presented to his pediatrician and was treated with amoxicillin for a confirmed GAS pharyngitis. He presented to the ED on day 6 with fever, atraumatic left knee pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion (ROM) and was admitted after a workup suggested septic arthritis. MRI identified Brodie's abscess of his distal femur. Wound cultures grew Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS). Following a 4-day hospitalization with IV clindamycin, he was transitioned to cephalexin and discharged. On day 22, he returned with knee pain, swelling, warmth, and decreased ROM. Repeat MRI showed recurrent subperiosteal abscess and osteomyelitis of the femur with Brodie's abscess. After a course of IV clindamycin and 2 surgical debridements, he was discharged with complete resolution at 2-month follow-up. This Brodie's abscess case was attributed to a recent streptococcal pharyngitis, highlighting the importance of history taking, a high index of suspicion, and complications of streptococcal infections. CONCLUSIONS Physicians are taught that a child with a limp needs an X-ray to rule out a fracture, and if the X-rays are negative, an arthrocentesis to rule out a septic joint. Due to the increased incidence of more invasive streptococcal strains, MRI imaging may be needed to rule out Brodie's abscess in children, especially those with recent streptococcal infections.","[('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('osteomyelitis', 'DISEASE'), ('atraumatic limb pain', 'DISEASE'), ('systemic infection', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pharyngitis', 'DISEASE'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('sore throat', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('GAS pharyngitis', 'DISEASE'), ('fever', 'DISEASE'), ('left knee pain', 'DISEASE'), ('swelling', 'DISEASE'), ('septic arthritis', 'DISEASE'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalexin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('knee pain', 'DISEASE'), ('swelling', 'DISEASE'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('osteomyelitis', 'DISEASE'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('streptococcal pharyngitis', 'DISEASE'), ('streptococcal infections', 'DISEASE'), ('fracture', 'DISEASE'), ('septic', 'DISEASE'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('streptococcal infections', 'DISEASE')]"

This study aimed to reveal UTI prevalence in Jordan, identify risk practices, assess antibiotic adherence, and evaluate UTI recurrence among pregnant women. A prospective observational cohort study, conducted from January to July 2023, was employed to Urinary tract infections (UTIs) during pregnancy. Participants were recruited during routine visits to Al-Bashir Governmental Hospital and Jamil Al-Totenji Governmental Hospital maternity clinics in Jordan. Binary logistic regression identified UTI predictors among pregnant women. Out of 536 participants, 34.3% of pregnant women were found to have UTIs. Amoxicillin/clavulanate demonstrated the highest level of resistance among the tested antibiotics and 42.4% of the pregnant participants adhered to the prescribed antibiotic regimen. Several factors were identified as contributing to an elevated risk of UTIs, including elevated body mass index (BMI) (P = .011), utilization of dry toilet paper (P = .023), frequent utilization of public restroom facilities (P < .001), delayed urination (P < .001), nonuse of cotton underwear (P = .019), frequent sexual activity (P < .001), lack of postcoital urination (P < .001), and inadequate genital hygiene before (P < .001) and after (P < .001) intercourse (including the husband's).

This study examines factors influencing access to veterinary services and antibiotic use among livestock-owning households in the Asante Akim North District, Ghana, and the Nouna District, Burkina Faso. METHODS: In Burkina Faso a simple randomization was carried out, whereas in Ghana a double-stage cluster sampling was applied. A cross-sectional survey collected socio-demographic and economic data, along with information on veterinary access and antibiotic use. The data collection was conducted between February and March 2023 in Ghana, and from July to November 2023 in Burkina Faso. Data analysis employed descriptive statistics, and logistic regressions. RESULTS: Among the sampled households, 415 (37.3%) in Ghana and 521 (51.5%) in Burkina Faso owned livestock. Antibiotics were administered to both sick and healthy animals, mainly amoxicillin (22%) in Ghana and tetracycline (7.25%) in Burkina Faso. In Ghana, individuals with no religious affiliation (aOR: 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 - 0.48, p= 0.008), and semi-urban residents (aOR: 0.34, 95% CI 0.21 - 0.54, p= >0.001) had lower access to veterinary services, while those in the highest socioeconomic quartile had greater access (aOR: 3.38, 95% CI 1.82 - 6.27, p= >0.001). In Burkina Faso, socio-economic status and residence were confounding factors. Stratified analysis showed semi-urban residents and wealthier groups had better veterinary access, unlike rural populations. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to address antibiotic use through stronger regulations, improved access to veterinary services, and targeted education programs to prevent AMR among populations in West Africa.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL')]"

40294449,2025,"The heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction with modified zeolite was introduced for the removal of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) to reduce environmental impact of the substance residues in swine farm effluent. The heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction with 100 g/L of the modified zeolite and 2 mM H(2)O(2) could completely remove amoxicillin (AMX), tetracycline (TC), and tiamulin (TIA) in the swine farm effluent within 30 min. However, the antibiotic removal in the swine farm effluent was slower than in the ultrapure water. The heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction removed approximately 45-60% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and reduced the dissolved organic matter (DOM) sizes in the swine farm effluent. The large molecular size humic-like DOM co-existing in the swine farm effluent could probably decelerate the antibiotic removal via competitive adsorption and oxidation. To inactivate high-tolerant AMX-resistant E. coli, the heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction required 3-fold less exposure time than the H(2)O(2) oxidation. No regrowth of the high-tolerant AMX-resistant E. coli was observed when the exposure time of the heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction was longer than 6 h. The heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction required the exposure time of 24 h to reduce the blaTEM genes, the AMX-resistant genes, of the high-tolerant AMX-resistant E. coli to the level of lower than the limit of detection. The results suggest that different reaction times are required for the removal of antibiotics (within 30 min), ARB (over 6 h), and ARGs (within 24 h). Furthermore, the heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction with the modified zeolite is a promising technology for sequential and efficient removal of antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs residues in swine farm effluent before being discharged into the environment.","[('heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction', 'DISEASE'), ('zeolite', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ARB', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tiamulin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TIA', 'DISEASE'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbon', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DOM', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('humic-like DOM', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction', 'DISEASE'), ('heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction', 'DISEASE'), ('heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction', 'DISEASE'), ('ARB', 'CHEMICAL'), ('heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction', 'DISEASE'), ('zeolite', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ARB', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40290945,2025,"The development of biocompatible biopolymer foams loaded with antibiotics is crucial to advancing drug delivery systems in biomedical engineering. These materials offer controlled drug release and specialized functionalities for improved therapeutic outcomes. This study presents the development and characterization of antimicrobial polymeric biofoam materials loaded with the drug amoxicillin (AMX). The sustainable synthesis of these biopolymer foams involves a cost-effective, eco-friendly method that incorporates natural starch within poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) through an aldehyde cross-linking/stabilizing process. The highly porous structure of the biofoams enabled effective impregnation of the AMX drug using an innovative process involving ultrasonication and vacuum pressure to maximize efficiency and minimize biomaterial loss. The findings demonstrate the potential of these PVA/starch-based biofoams as versatile drug delivery systems with desirable physicochemical and biological characteristics. Detailed investigations were conducted to evaluate morphological features, chemical properties, swelling behavior, in vitro biodegradability, drug release profiles, cell culture, and antimicrobial activity tests of the prepared biofoam samples. Investigating the effect of controlled loading of AMX under laboratory conditions on its release profile and studying its biodegradation in various environments over time represent a critical aspect of this research. The optimal release profile under physiological conditions and the potent inhibition of bacterial growth against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus microorganisms by AMX-loaded biofoam materials highlight their potential for biomedical applications.

OBJECTIVE: Given the limited real-world evidence, this study aims to analyse the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System to investigate the association between various antibiotics and SJS/TEN risk. METHODS: Reports from infected patients (Q1 2014-Q4 2023) were extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. Disproportionality analysis using information component identified risk signals of antibiotics associated with SJS/TEN. Subgroup analyses investigated the impact of age and gender on antibiotic-associated SJS/TEN. Also, a time of onset analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among 78 593 infected patients, 1221 cases of SJS/TEN were identified from 30 369 antibiotic administrations. The median age of patients with SJS was 63 y, and with TEN was 60 y. Eleven positive signal drugs were detected through disproportionality analysis. Amoxicillin, piperacillin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, vancomycin, doxycycline, and gentamicin exhibited significant risk associations with SJS/TEN. Sulfamethoxazole had the highest risk. Patients with pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis had higher risks than those with respiratory tract infections. Male patients using specific antibiotics may have a higher risk than females, with no significant age difference. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics including penicillins, cephalosporins, azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, vancomycin, doxycycline, and gentamicin are associated with an increased risk of SJS/TEN, with sulfamethoxazole presenting the highest risk.

The strain SA-10GR was isolated from moribund veliger larvae of the scallop Spondylus limbatus. SA-10GR was identified as Vibrio rotiferianus by phenotypic characterization and whole genome sequence analysis. SA-10GR is a strain with lytic activity, susceptible to many antibiotics except amoxicillin (25 mug), capable of producing siderophores and extracellular products with alkaline phosphatase, esterase, lipase esterase, leucine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, among others. The genome of V. rotiferianus consists of 5,579,217 bp; 5160 genes; 5086 protein-coding sequences (CDSs); 74 RNA genes (57 tRNA, 13 rRNA, and 4 ncRNA), and 40 pseudogenes. A total of six resistance genes vanT, adeF, E. coli parE, txR, CRP, and PBP3 were identified, and 110 virulence factors were detected.

The second step was to investigate the effect of levamisole as a feed supplement for tilapia fish on growth performance, immunity, serum biochemistry, and the protective effect against artificial infection with the previously isolated in the first step P. aeruginosa strain. One hundred samples were collected from morbid Nile tilapia fish in the first step. The incidence of P. aeruginosa was 14%. Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolates to 9 antimicrobial agents showed that about half of P. aeruginosa isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) to (5-6) antibiotics. All of the isolates were sensitive to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin (100%), and half of them were resistant to azithromycin, amoxicillin with clavulanic, tetracycline, and sulfa with trimethoprim. P. aeruginosa isolates were confirmed diagnosed using the 16S rRNA gene, which was detected in 100% of the tested isolates, and was also evaluated for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (blaTEM, tetA, and sul1), which were 85.7%, 85.7%, and 100%, respectively. In the second step, a 2-month feeding trial was performed on 160 O. niloticus fish with a weight of 56.75 +/- 3 g. Fish were randomly distributed into four groups, each at a rate of 10 fish per aquarium in four replicates, and fed on a diet containing 0.0, 500, 750, and 1000 mg levamisole/kg diet.

Particularly, despite significant decrease in surface area upon DEX functionalization, a remarkable enhancement in adsorption removal efficiency was observed, underscoring the pivotal role of surface chemistry over surface area alone. The AC/KCC-1/DEX exhibited 87.64 m(2)/g and 122.94 m(2)/g of micropore and mesopores surface area, respectively, along with reactive functional group of DEX such as -OH, which increase surface polarity and enables strong interactions with polar pharmaceuticals.

Compared with controls, treatment of cervical cancer (HeLa) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (SAS) cells with 10 mug/mL AMPC significantly increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced mitochondrial Fe(2+) levels. This concentration is equivalent to the maximum blood levels of AMPC used in Helicobacter pylori eradication. The viability of HeLa and SAS cells was significantly reduced when cisplatin was administrated after AMPC; however, this effect was not observed in normal human fibroblast-like lung cells (VA-13) or human periodontal ligament fibroblast (HPLF) cells. AMPC did not enhance the anticancer effect of docetaxel. The AMPC-enhanced anticancer effect of cisplatin was blocked by the iron-chelating agent phenanthroline, indicating that the effect was primarily driven by ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death.

This review article evaluates the effectiveness of 14-day mono-antibiotic therapies for H. pylori infection through randomized controlled trials conducted from 1 October 2014 to 1 October 2024. The pooled eradication rates for 14-day high-dose amoxicillin/proton pump inhibitor (PPI) dual therapies were 86.1% (3335/3875; 95% confidence interval (CI): 85.1-87.2%) by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 87.3% (3232/3702; 95% CI: 86.2-88.4%) by per-protocol (PP) analysis. For 14-day high-dose amoxicillin/vonoprazan dual therapies, the rates were 87.4% (1085/1241; 95% CI: 85.5-89.2%) by ITT and 93.0% (1044/1124; 95% CI: 91.5-94.5%) by PP.

For S. aureus, the pooled resistance was highest for penicillins (ampicillin = 100%; penicillin = 93.64%; and amoxicillin = 77.82%) followed by cefuroxime (51.23%). The pooled prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 19.30%. SCD patients had 2.89 and 2.47 times higher odds of being colonized or infected with penicillin-resistant and erythromycin-resistant S. aureus strains, respectively. For S. pneumoniae, resistance prevalence was highest for co-trimoxazole (81.1%), followed by penicillin (47.08%). The pooled prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. pneumoniae isolates was 32.12%. The majority of the studies included (n = 14, 77.8%) were of moderate quality according to the modified STROBE checklist. Conclusions: This review reveals a high prevalence of AMR with regard to SCD patients. SCD patients have an increased risk of resistance to penicillin and co-trimoxazole across several bacterial pathogens. The limited geographical distribution of the included studies underscores the urgent need for expanded AMR research on the subject, especially in regions with high SCD burden.","[('sickle cell disease', 'DISEASE'), ('SCD', 'DISEASE'), ('SCD', 'DISEASE'), ('SCD', 'DISEASE'), ('Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('SCD', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin-resistant', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-trimoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('SCD', 'DISEASE'), ('SCD', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-trimoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('SCD', 'DISEASE')]"
40276424,2025,"Ludwig's angina (LA) is a life-threatening, rapidly progressive infection of the submandibular, sublingual, and submental spaces, often caused by odontogenic infections. We report the case of an eight-year-old previously healthy girl who developed LA following untreated dental caries. She presented with a four-day history of odontalgia, left hemifacial edema, and trismus. Despite an initial course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, her condition worsened, leading to hospital admission. Examination revealed fever (38.1 degrees C), painful left submandibular swelling, trismus, and molar caries. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting severe infection. Intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate and clindamycin were initiated, but symptoms progressed with increasing pain, sublingual swelling, and worsening trismus. A cervical CT confirmed an abscess in the left sublingual space with extensive periradicular lytic lesions. Urgent surgical intervention included extraction of teeth 36 and 75 and abscess drainage, which revealed purulent material. Postoperatively, the patient improved with a 14-day antibiotic course, resolving fever and swelling.

The present study aimed to assess drinking water quality by analysing antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) and their spatial distribution, identifying contamination hotspots using integrated physicochemical, microbial, and advanced geospatial assessments on 122 samples collected from surface and groundwater of semi-arid areas with key physicochemical parameters analysed using standard methods. Microbial contamination was assessed through heterotrophic plate counts and coliform tests, detecting E. coli (n = 83 isolates) that underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing via the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method against eleven antibiotics. Results showed that several key physicochemical (total dissolved solids, alkalinity, fluoride, and calcium) and microbial parameters exceeded WHO permissible limits. Correlation analysis revealed significant relationships among water quality indicators in both water sources. Advanced geospatial techniques, including Empirical Bayesian Kriging and Getis-Ord Gi cluster analysis, enabled spatial interpolation of studied parameters and identified significant antibiotic-resistant E. coli clusters in 15 wards. The antibiogram showed high resistance levels, with 91.6% of isolates resistant to oxacillin, 83.1% to amoxicillin, and 63.9% to ciprofloxacin, complemented by the Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Index reaching up to 0.83 indicating a high risk of contamination. Spatial-cluster analysis pinpointed high-risk areas exhibiting significant antibiotic-resistant E. coli clusters.

40272011,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tegoprazan, a new class of drugs, is a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) that inhibits gastric H+/K+-ATPase through a different mechanism than proton pump inhibitor. Tetracycline also has anti-Helicobacter pylori properties. However, only a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the efficacy of tegoprazan and tetracycline-containing quadruple therapy (TTQT) for treating H. pylori infections, which this RCT explored. METHODS: This multicenter RCT included treatment-naive adults with H. pylori infection who received 7 or 14 days of TTQT (50-mg tegoprazan, 220-mg bismuth potassium citrate, and 1000-mg amoxicillin twice daily with 500-mg tetracycline four times daily). The primary outcome was the eradication rate; secondary endpoints included the incidence of adverse events, treatment compliance, and regimen costs. RESULTS: The study included 258 patients. The eradication rates in the 7- and 14-day groups were 90.70% (117/129, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.98%-94.89%) and 91.47% (118/129, 95% CI: 84.90%-95.45%), respectively, in the intention-to-treat analysis (difference: -0.78%; -7.01%-8.58%; noninferiority p < 0.001); 92.86% (117/126, 95% CI: 86.50%-96.48%) and 93.65% (118/126, 95% CI: 87.47%-97.02%), respectively, in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (difference: 0.79%; 95% CI: -6.36%-7.99%; noninferiority p < 0.001); and 94.35% (117/124, 95% CI: 88.29%-97.50%) and 95.12% (117/123, 95% CI: 89.24%-98.00%), respectively, in the per-protocol analysis (difference: -0.77%; 95% CI: -5.91%-7.48%; noninferiority p < 0.001).

Using the wet impregnation method, kaolin clay and TiO(2)-P25 composites were doped with copper (Cu(2+)) and cobalt (Co(2+)). The produced materials were characterized by SEM-EDS, XRD, XRF, textural property analysis, and their potential lixiviation of components by ICP-MS. The photodegradation efficiency under solar irradiation was evaluated by varying the acidity of the medium, the concentration of AMX, and the amount of catalyst. The performance of the recycled photocatalysts was also studied. The photodegradation of AMX was monitored by UV-Vis and UV-Vis/HPLC spectrophotometry. The optimal formulations, Cu (0.1%)/TiO(2) and Co (0.1%)/TiO(2), achieved up to 95% degradation of 5 mg.L(-1) AMX in 3 h at pH 5.9, with a catalyst loading of 1 g.L(-1). The Cu-doped material showed a slightly faster reaction rate and higher total-organic-carbon removal (80.4%) compared to the Co-doped material (59%) under identical conditions. The same photodegradation intermediates were identified by LC-MS/MS for both doped macrocomposites, and a reaction mechanism is proposed.

This report presents an unusual case of lumbar osteomyelitis and an iliopsoas muscle abscess caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella in an immunocompetent pediatric patient with a multidrug allergy. A 13-year-old boy presented with fever and lumbar pain. Diagnostic imaging revealed lumbar osteomyelitis and an iliopsoas abscess. Blood culture and initial iliopsoas puncture tissue sample test results were negative. Therefore, cefazolin was administered as empirical therapy for covering typical organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species causing vertebral osteomyelitis in healthy children. However, genetic testing of the biopsy sample of the vertebral tissue subsequently identified Salmonella spp. as the causative agent. Culture of the vertebral tissue also yielded Salmonella spp., with the O-antigen identified as type 4. Antibiotic selection was challenging because of the patient's drug allergies and age. Treatment was commenced with ceftriaxone and later changed to ampicillin owing to adverse drug reactions. The side effects, such as rash, fever, and nausea, persisted after switching to oral sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, which was later changed to amoxicillin. Although the treatment duration of vertebral Salmonella osteomyelitis in children is not standardized, we treated the patient for 9 weeks based on previously reported evidence.

40269996,2025,"BACKGROUND: The common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) is found in aquatic environments throughout sub-Saharan Africa and is known to cause attacks on humans living or working close to water bodies. Victims surviving an attack often suffer from the consequences of severe wound infections caused by the animal's sharp canine teeth. OBJECTIVE: Isolation of normal flora bacteria from the oral cavity of common hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibious) followed by antibiotic susceptibility testing to aid in the identification of a targeted antibiotic treatment regimen for hippopotamus attack victims. METHODS: Oral swabs were collected from 34 free-ranging hippopotami in three reserves within the Greater Kruger National Park Complex in South Africa and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was conducted using the disc diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer method) and a panel of 16 antibiotic drugs representing 10 antibiotic categories. RESULTS: Culturing of 50 oral swab samples from 34 hippopotami yielded 188 aerobic isolates belonging to 30 bacterial genera and 41 bacterial species (Gram-negative: 70.7%; Gram-positive: 29.3%) and 16 obligate anaerobic isolates from two genera. Three bacterial species, namely Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria and Shewanella putrefaciens accounted for 52% of the aerobic isolates. The anaerobic isolates were identified as Prevotella melaninogenica and Clostridium spp. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for 112 aerobic isolates (Gram-negative: 93 (83%); Gram-positive: 19 (17%)) representing all isolated bacterial species. High levels of antibiotic resistance were observed among the Gram-negative species especially to most beta-lactam antibiotics (50.5% to 80.7%). Multidrug resistance was detected in 22.6% of Gram-negative isolates and in 24.1% of all isolates. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first investigation of the oral flora bacteria of the common hippopotamus. Among the 32 mostly aerobic bacterial genera the most abundant bacterial species were A. hydrophila, A. sobria and S. putrefaciens. They are typical inhabitants of the aquatic habitat of the hippopotamus and of zoonotic importance as opportunistic human pathogens. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles demonstrated that quinolones, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines were highly efficacious against these bacterial species which otherwise showed moderate to high levels of resistance to the traditional bite wound treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate and 1st and 2nd generation cephalosporins.","[('attacks', 'DISEASE'), ('wound infections', 'DISEASE'), ('Clostridium', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('A. hydrophila', 'DISEASE'), ('quinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracyclines', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL')]"

CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-month-old boy presented with unresolved fever and was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis. Despite prior treatment with amoxicillin and paracetamol, the fever persisted, accompanied by leukopenia. Intravenous C-penicillin was initiated, but respiratory distress ensued, necessitating non-invasive ventilatory support and subsequent intubation due to increased stridor. Intubation was challenging due to copious secretions and a floppy epiglottis, but successful intubation was achieved on the second attempt using a C-MAC((R)) video laryngoscope with a Miller blade size 0. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large collection with mucosal involvement in the peritonsillar and tonsillar regions, extending to adjacent structures. Direct laryngoscopy, tissue sampling, and multiple surgical debridements were performed as the patient's condition deteriorated. Perianal excoriation and diarrhea raised suspicion of primary immunodeficiency syndrome. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were isolated from tissue cultures and effectively treated with targeted antibiotics. Serological testing showed positive IgG for herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), while immune deficiency testing indicated a normal immune status, pending genetic testing results. After 21 days of ventilation, the patient was extubated, received non-invasive ventilatory support, and was discharged with oral antibiotics.

40268254,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Antibiotics are important tools in the armamentarium for treating infectious diseases. In Europe most available antibiotics have been licensed in the past through so-called national procedures, meaning that antibiotic labels (e.g., therapeutic indications, posology, contra-indications) may vary across European member states. As a result, antibiotics are prescribed in the EU with different directions of use. This study aims to evaluate whether on streamlining the product information of antibiotics in the period 2007-2020 has been sufficiently implemented. Specifically, it examines whether member states and pharmaceutical companies have fulfilled their obligation to update the therapeutic indication sections of the amoxicillin containing medicines label according to the outcomes of the referral. METHOD: We performed a follow-up of the previous study measuring five years after the referral's conclusion and decision whether and how complete the indication sections of the product information for one of 15 antibiotics that underwent referral procedures during the previous study period (2007-2020) were updated. We have chosen amoxicillin as case example for this study as it is the most frequently used antibiotic in the primary care setting, and the referral took place mid-term 2007-2020,-with a conclusion in 2015. RESULTS: In total we could identify 806 medicinal products with an active pharmaceutical ingredient amoxicillin available in 2015 across 30 EEA countries and the UK. We found that in 22 % (176 out of 806) amoxicillin products still included therapeutic indications that should have been removed from the SmPC following the 2015 referral procedure. The most frequent therapeutic indications that were incorrectly still listed in the indication sections of the product information were endocarditis treatment (oral formulation) in 55 % (97 out of 176 products), followed by lower respiratory tract infections 49 % (87 out of 176 products), and upper respiratory tract infections 46 % (81 out of 176 products). CONCLUSION: Inconsistencies in therapeutic indications continue to pose challenges, potentially impacting the safe and effective use of antibiotics. Such discrepancies can lead to misuse or inappropriate prescribing of crucial antibiotics, contributing to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. Our study highlights the importance of following up on and verifying the implementation of finalized regulatory procedures at EU level. Further research is needed to understand the root causes of incomplete implementations, possibly also due to incomplete updates of the EMA Article 57 database.","[('infectious diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('endocarditis', 'DISEASE'), ('lower respiratory tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('upper respiratory tract infections', 'DISEASE')]"

40267379,2025,"PURPOSE: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common cancer complication in children. A growing body of evidence suggests that home-based care with oral antibiotics is safe and effective in carefully selected children with low-risk (LR) FN. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral levofloxacin versus oral amoxicillin-clavulanate/ciprofloxacin in the management of LR-FN in children with cancer over a time horizon of 7 days from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a randomized controlled study conducted at the NCI from December 2021 to September 2022, including children and adolescents age between 3 and 18 years who presented to the emergency room with LR-FN criteria with the exclusion of patients younger than 3 years and patients with Down syndrome. One hundred LR-FN episodes were enrolled in each arm. Patient demographics, microbiologic data, and outcomes were collected at different time points. A decision analytic model was created to compare the two treatment strategies. The outcome measures included quality-adjusted FN episodes, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Levofloxacin was a safe and effective treatment option for LR-FN. It proved to be the dominant strategy against amoxicillin-clavulanate/ciprofloxacin with an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.0001 and a lower cost of 62.4996 Egyptian pounds (EGPs) in the treatment of home-based LR-FN with a willingness to pay a threshold of 77,520 EGPs per QALY (1 gross domestic product/capita). CONCLUSION: For the treatment of FN in pediatric patients with cancer, levofloxacin offers a cost-saving option with improved survival benefits over a 7-day time horizon from the NCI perspective.

40266303,2025,"Antibacterial drugs are widely used in modern medicine, but their efficacy is increasingly threatened by antimicrobial resistance and ongoing supply shortages. This study examines the relationships among the 15 most prescribed antibacterial substances in Germany, analysing the correlations and trends of prescribed defined daily dose (DDD) of antibacterial drugs within the outpatient care sector under statutory health insurance from 1986 to 2022. Three groups of drugs with similar consumption trajectories were identified. The first group, including doxycycline, phenoxymethylpenicillin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, showed declining trends with stable trajectories, its similarities being confirmed by overlapping indications such as respiratory tract infections and declining usage due to guideline changes. The second group, comprising amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime and pivmecillinam, displayed increasing trends with continuous trajectories. The third group, including ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and cefaclor, shared declining trends with fluctuating trajectories, often related to bacterial resistance rates and substitution by other antibacterial drugs. Frequently prescribed substances often show many and strong correlations in consumption, indicating that they are more related with other substances and being susceptible to external factors, such as changes in costs, sudden events like the COVID pandemic or guideline recommendations. Less commonly used medicines, typically for niche indications, tend to have a more stable consumption trend and being less influenced by broader trends, resulting in fewer significant correlations. Distinguishing direct effects of changes in consumption from one drug to another from common but unrelated responses to external events remains a challenge, as there are many factors that can influence consumption.

Even when only domestic sources are considered (i.e. not including veterinary or industrial sources), we estimate that 6 million km of rivers worldwide are subject to total antibiotic concentrations in excess of thresholds that are protective of ecosystems and resistance promotion during low streamflow conditions, with the dominant contributors being amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and cefixime. Therefore, it is of concern that human consumption alone represents a significant risk for rivers across all continents, with the largest extents found in Southeast Asia. Global antibiotic consumption has grown rapidly over the last 15 years and continues to increase, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, requiring new strategies to safeguard water quality and protect human and ecosystem health.","[('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefixime', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40261077,2025,"The objective of this study was to describe the use of and outcomes after suppressive antimicrobial therapy (SAT) in a large prospective peri-prosthetic joint infection (PJI) cohort. SAT was defined as antimicrobial therapy continuing beyond 12 months from PJI diagnosis or where there was an early intention for SAT. The primary outcome was ""treatment failure"" at 24 months, defined as any of (i) clinical evidence of (ii) further surgery for or (iii) death from PJI. Secondary outcomes included quality of life (QOL) scores using Short Form 12 (SF-12) and Oxford hip (OHS) and knee (OKS) scores. SAT was prescribed for 223 of 720 (31.0%) in the cohort. Patients prescribed SAT were more likely to be older, have comorbidities, chronic PJI, higher C-reactive protein, sinus tract, or be treated with debridement and implant retention. The most frequently prescribed antimicrobials for SAT were ciprofloxacin (64 [21%]), amoxicillin (42 [14%]), and rifampicin (35 [12%]). Treatment failure was more common in the SAT group (75/185 [40.1%] vs 85/447 [19.0%]). After propensity score-adjusted analysis, SAT remained associated with higher rates of treatment failure (aOR 2.48, 95% CI [1.66-3.72]). Although 24-month QOL scores were lower in the SAT group, there were similar improvements from baseline in functional joint scores in SAT and non-SAT groups (OHS median interquartile range [IQR] +8.5 [19.0] vs +7.0 [22.0]; P = 0.78 and OKS +8.0 [20.0] vs +7.0 [22.0]; P = 0.53). SAT use for PJI is common, and in this study, it was not associated with improved outcomes.

40261017,2025,"Biomethane, a clean energy source, plays a crucial role in addressing global energy and environmental challenges. However, its production has long been limited by the complexity of methanogenic precursor synthesis and the involvement of diverse microbial strains, creating a bottleneck in methane conversion. To address this, the present study explores the potential of the beta-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin (AMX) to enhance methanogenesis by selectively shaping microbial communities while preserving core methanogenic pathways. Results indicate that the addition of AMX significantly improves methanogenic performance. By day 25, methane yield increased by 3.89-fold, and carbon substrate utilization efficiency improved by 15.5% compared to the control group. This enhancement is linked to the selective effect of AMX on the methanogenic community, leading to a 61.51% increase in the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea. This approach optimizes the process by bypassing three stages of methane precursor synthesis, reducing interfering bacteria, and improving methanogenic efficiency and process controllability, all while showing no significant negative environmental impacts from the added antibiotics. IMPORTANCE: This study holds significant importance in advancing biomethane production, a clean and renewable energy source. By utilizing amoxicillin, the research promotes the selective growth of methane-producing microbes while suppressing harmful ones, resulting in faster and more efficient methane production with enhanced process control. In addition, amoxicillin degrades rapidly within the system, resulting in minimal negative environmental impact. This work provides a promising and eco-friendly approach to optimize biomethane production, offering a viable and sustainable solution for energy generation from waste.","[('methane', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('methane', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbon', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('methane', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('methane', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40258868,2025,"Constructed wetlands use vegetation as a natural medium to filter out pollutants from wastewater. It is simple to use, low maintenance, low running costs, sustainable, and eco-friendly. This has led to numerous studies to evaluate its performance in treating pollutants, including pharmaceutical compounds, ranging from conventional to emerging contaminants. However, there is still a lack of work on removal efficiency of pharmaceutical compounds individually assessed with conventional parameters removal. In this study, two horizontal flow constructed wetlands were fabricated; one constructed wetland was made with plants and other without plant. The pharmaceuticals used for this study are Levofloxacin, Amoxicillin, Ketorolac, Fluconazole and Aspirin. The water samples were collected as grab samples after 24 h of duration. The conventional and non-conventional parameters were studied for influent and effluent wastewater. From the results, it was found that significant removal efficiencies were observed in all parameters. The removal efficiency of above pharmaceuticals in PCW follows the order Fluconazole (98%) > Aspirin (98%) > Levofloxacin (98%) > Ketorolac (88%) > Amoxicillin (52.18%).

Methods After urine samples were inoculated on cysteine lactose-deficient agar culture media, isolated colonies were identified using standard biochemical tests. These isolates were then screened using different phenotypic confirmatory methods for beta-lactamase detection and the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results Out of the total urine samples, 7.08 per cent (177/2500) were positive for the growth of E. coli, out of which 40.11 per cent (71/177) were multi-drug resistant. Among the 71 isolates, 31 per cent were ESBL producers, 62 per cent were AmpC producers, and 7.04 and 4.22 per cent were co-producers of ESBL and AmpC, and AmpC and MBL, respectively. The E. coli isolates were found to be highly resistant to ciprofloxacin (83.61%), amoxicillin/clavulanate (81.92%), and gentamicin (61%). However, these were sensitive to imipenem (98.3%), fosfomycin (97.17%), and nitrofurantoin (94.35%).

40253972,2025,"This research examines the impacts of amoxicillin and copper, separately and together, on the taxonomic and functional diversity of free-living marine nematodes. Sediment samples were gathered from the Jeddah shoreline in Saudi Arabia, and meiobenthic organisms were subjected to two concentrations of amoxicillin [550 and 1100 ng/L] and copper [130 mg/kg dry weight (dw) and 260 mg/kg dw] in microcosms for 30 days. The findings indicated a higher nematode tolerance than that of polychaetes, copepods, isopods, amphipods, and cumaceans. A notable decrease in both nematode species abundance and diversity was observed as contaminant levels rose, resulting in the reduction of sensitive bioindicators, specifically Paracanthonchus sadspitensis, Dorylaimopsis timmi, Cinctonema papillata, Eleutherolaimus obtusicaudatus, Terschellingia longicaudata, Theristus poloris, Halalaimus longicaudatus, Parodontophora breviseta, and Theristus pertenuis for copper, as well as C. papillata, T. longicaudata, H. longicaudatus, T. pertenuis, D. timmi, and Viscosia viscosia for amoxicillin. Conversely, tolerant/opportunistic species such as Metoncholaimus albidus for amoxicillin and Daptonema oxycerca for both copper and amoxicillin showed an increase in abundance. The pairing of amoxicillin and copper demonstrated a synergistic or additive toxic impact. Furthermore, pollution changed the functional characteristics of nematodes, leading to a rise in detritivore species with clavate tails, and a decline in microvore species with conical and filiform tails.

The isolates were identified as Acinetobacter pseudolwoffii, A. gerneri, A. gandensis, and A. amyesii and screened their genomes for the presence of genes related to host colonization, infection, or environmental persistence. We detected 164 genes of antimicrobial resistance, virulence factors, mobile genetic elements, or biofilm formation. All isolates were predicted to be human pathogens with high probability (0.7-0.8) and the manure isolates identified as A. pseudolwoffii carried a top-risk human-associated aminoglycoside resistance gene. The phenotypic characterization of the isolates showed that they could all grow at 37  degrees C, some up to 41  degrees C, and that they showed differential susceptibility to several antibiotics, with one isolate identified as A. gandensis being multi-resistant.

This study sought to determine the level of appropriateness of antibiotics for ENT infections and its associated factors in ambulatory care in a teaching hospital in Ghana to guide future policies given rising resistance rates. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study design was undertaken to audit the quality of antibiotic use in Ho Teaching Hospital, a leading teaching hospital in Ghana, between January 2022 to December 2022. A checklist was designed to extract patient socio-demographic and clinical information from electronic medical records. The main study outcome was the appropriate choice of antibiotics principally in accordance to the Ghana standard treatment guidelines. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed on the data collected using STATA version 14. RESULTS: The electronic medical records of a total of 3,279 patients were extracted. The majority (57.88%, n = 1898) of patients were females, median (inter-quartile range) age was 25 [7-42] years. Ear infections were the commonest (66.24%, n = 2172) diagnosed ENT infection, followed by throat infections (15.74%, n = 516). The most prescribed antibiotic was oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid together with a topical neomycin-steroid combination (28.00%, n = 918), followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid alone (18.69%, n = 613). The appropriate choice of antibiotic for all ENT infections in accordance with treatment guidelines was 60.11%. Inappropriate use of antibiotics was high when more than one antibiotic and World Health Organisation (WHO) 'Watch' group antibiotics were prescribed and ear infections compared to the nose and throat infections were treated. CONCLUSION: The appropriateness of antibiotic use for ENT infections in this hospital was suboptimal.

40250499,2025,"OBJECTIVES: The global rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a critical threat to public health, with the overuse of antibiotics in livestock being a key driver of this escalating problem. However, research on livestock-associated AMR remains limited, with few systematic monitoring efforts. This study addresses this gap by presenting findings from our surveillance of Escherichia coli resistance in pig farms in Zhejiang Province, China. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined via broth microdilution-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The complete genome sequence was acquired using both Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platforms. In the plasmid conjugation experiment, sodium azide-resistant E. coli strain J53 served as the recipient. The E. coli genomes were analyzed for AMR genes, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) types, plasmid types, and virulence genes using the ABRicate. RESULTS: A total of 51 E. coli strains from 90 fecal samples collected across six farms. Resistance rates for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and sulfamethoxazole exceeded 90 %, while resistance to ampicillin, florfenicol, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was above 80 %. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains was 89.24 %. Whole-genome sequencing revealed 58 acquired AMR genes and 17 virulence-associated genes, notably including the astA gene. Two strains exhibited meropenem resistance and carried bla(NDM-5), located on IncI1-I plasmids. These strains shared an identical genetic context, characterized by an ""IS26-IS30-bla(NDM-5)-ble(MBL)-dsdD-IS91'' structure, which may promote horizontal gene transfer of bla(NDM-5). Additionally, six strains harbored the tet(X4) gene.

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of treating H. pylori infection on seizure frequency among children with drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). METHODS: A parallel, two-arm, open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted on 126 children with drug-resistant IGE and positive H. pylori stool antigen test who were randomly assigned to study and comparison groups in 1.2:1 ratio. Only the study group received H. pylori eradication therapy (esomeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin) for two weeks. The primary outcome was seizure improvement (>/= 50% seizure frequency reduction compared with baseline) after 2.5 months. Secondary outcomes were occurrence of status epilepticus, escalation of antiseizure medication (ASMs), and adverse effects. Outcomes between the two groups were compared using Chi-square/Fisher exact tests on an intention-to-treat principle. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate possible effects of baseline variables on primary outcome. RESULTS: Seizure improvement occurred in 23 (33%) children in the study group compared with seven (12%) children in the comparison group (Risk ratio [RR] 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-5.9; p 0.006). The study group had lower occurrence of status epilepticus (2.9% vs. 14%; RR 0.21, 95%CI: 0.05-0.93; p 0.042) and lesser need for ASMs escalation (4.4% vs. 19.3%; RR 0.23, 95%CI: 0.07-0.77; p 0.010). Adverse effects were more frequent among subjects in the study group, including nausea (15.9% vs. 10.5%) vomiting (8.7% vs. 3.5%), diarrhea (11.6% vs. 5.3%), and skin rash (4.4% vs. 1.8%), but the differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). None of baseline participants' variables was significantly associated with the primary outcome.

40246956,2025,"Heavy metals have attracted considerable attention lately because of their widespread occurrence in aquatic environments and potential biological toxicity to animals and human. The current investigation focused on synthesizing the DAC@TCH nanobiosorbent by coupling dialdehyde cellulose with thiocarbohydrazide ligand. Subsequent characterization of DAC@TCH was carried out utilizing various analytical methods such as elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA and DTA). DFT calculations were utilized to verify the molecular structure, analysis of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and reactivity descriptor for all phases. In vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the biological properties of the DAC@TCH nanobiosorbent. These findings revealed that the synthesized DAC@TCH nanobiosorbent has been observed to show effective antibacterial IZD value against E. Coli (28 mm) which is superior to the efficacy of standard drug amoxicillin used (5 mm). Furthermore, in silico antibacterial activities (molecular docking) of the DAC@TCH have indicated this to exhibit excellent efficacy with docking score of (-7.4237 kcal/mol) and (-7.1325 kcal/mol) for S. aureus and, E. coli, respectively. Meanwhile the binding energies (best docking scores) in kcal/mol for Amoxicillin are (-5.8090) and (-6.7442) for S. aureus and, E. coli, respectively. Drug-likeness rules like Lipinski's, Veber's and Egan's were considered for a more comprehensive evaluation. The prepared DAC@TCH nanobiosorbent was investigated for its potential to adsorb metal ions (Ag(+), Hg(2+), and Cu(2+)) from diverse water samples. Optimal conditions including pH, temperature, DAC@TCH dosage, oscillation time, initial metal ion concentration, and interference from other ions were explored. The adsorption of Hg(2+), Cu(2+), and Ag(+) ions by DAC@TCH followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isothermal model, achieving maximum adsorption capacities of 196 mg/g for Ag(+), 190 mg/g for Hg(2+), and 73 mg/g for Cu(2+). The adsorption process was determined to be exothermic and spontaneous across varying temperatures. Additionally, over 95% of adsorbed metal ions were effectively desorbed using thiourea (5%) and 0.3 M HNO(3) elution mixture. DAC@TCH nanobiosorbent demonstrated excellent reusability, retaining its adsorption capacity through five cycles without degradation. The study highlights the potential of DAC@TCH for efficient recovery of heavy metals from different water sources, considering its application versatility, reusability, and minimal interference. Furthermore, the plausible mechanism of Ag(+), Hg(2+), and Cu(2+) adsorption onto DAC@TCH bionanosorbent is elucidated.","[('metals', 'DISEASE'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('DAC@TCH', 'CHEMICAL'), ('dialdehyde', 'CHEMICAL'), ('thiocarbohydrazide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DAC@TCH', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DAC@TCH', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DAC@TCH', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DAC@TCH', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DAC@TCH', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DAC@TCH', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DAC@TCH', 'CHEMICAL'), ('thiourea', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DAC@TCH', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DAC@TCH', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DAC@TCH', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40246155,2025,"The use of antibiotics such as amoxicillin can induce intestinal dysbiosis leading to rupture the essential microbiota role in regulating immune, metabolic, and reproductive functions. This study assessed the effects of amoxicillin-induced intestinal dysbiosis on the female mice reproductive function and its repercussions on their offspring. Female mice were treated with amoxicillin for 15 days (AMOX) showed an increase in Proteobacteria and a decrease in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in feces and estrous cycle changes, with a predominance of the metestrus and diestrus phases in the treated mice. During gestation the AMOX group presented reduced number of implantations and decreased embryonic viability, resulting in a higher rate of resorption. Differential gene expression of reproductive hormones in AMOX-treated female mice suggested that intestinal dysbiosis interferes with hormonal regulation during pregnancy. The survival, body development, and intestinal microbiota composition of offspring showed significantly altered patterns in the AMOX mice. These findings indicate that amoxicillin-induced intestinal dysbiosis affects not only the estrous cycle and reproductive hormones but also has lasting impacts on offspring development.

40243369,2025,"The global rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), driven by antibiotic use in healthcare and agriculture, poses a major public health threat. While AMR in clinical settings is well studied, there is a gap in understanding the resistance profiles of Escherichia coli from diseased livestock, particularly regarding zoonotic transmission. This study analyzes 114 E. coli isolates from diseased swine over 12 years, revealing that 99.12% were multidrug-resistant. Resistance was highest for ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (100%), followed by ciprofloxacin (96.49%) and tetracycline (94.74%). Furthermore, 21.05% of isolates were resistant to colistin, and 1.75% to tigecycline. A total of 76 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were identified, with mcr-1 found in 18.42%, mcr-3 in 4.39%, and tet(X4) in 1.75%. Significant co-occurrence of ARGs and plasmids suggests potential for co-selective dissemination. This study is the first to report enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strains carrying both mcr-1 and mcr-3 genes. After the 2017 colistin ban in China, mcr-1 detection rates significantly decreased, while florfenicol resistance rates increased in 2018-2021 (94.29%) compared to 2010-2017 (79.55%). This work provides valuable insights into the AMR profiles of E. coli from diseased swine and highlights trends that can inform strategies for monitoring and controlling public health risks associated with zoonotic E. coli transmission.IMPORTANCEThis study highlights the critical role of diseased and deceased swine in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), providing new insights into the transmission of resistance genes in zoonotic contexts. By analyzing E. coli from diseased swine, we identify key resistance genes such as mcr-1, mcr-3, and tet(X4), which pose significant public health risks, especially regarding last-resort antibiotics like colistin. Moreover, the study identifies novel transmission patterns of mcr genes, including ETEC strains carrying the mcr-3 gene and strains harboring both mcr-1 and mcr-3 genes. The role of plasmids in horizontal gene transfer is also revealed, facilitating rapid AMR spread across species.

40242434,2025,"The transmission of food-borne pathogens from wildlife to humans presents a significant public health challenge. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need to enhance our understanding of wild animals' role in transmitting infectious diseases. The handling and consumption of wild meat carry inherent risks of contracting foodborne illnesses. We analysed the prevalence of bacterial pathogens encountered in wild meat processing in four villages in southern Cameroon, highlighting the critical role of hygienic practices in preventing disease. We collected 100 samples from various utensils and surfaces involved in wild meat preparation and assessed them for bacterial contamination. We isolated 577 bacterial strains, of which 154 (27 %) were pathogenic, with a high prevalence (75 %) of pathogenic bacteria on commonly used utensils, with cooking pots identified as significant reservoirs of bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance among the order Enterobacteriales included high levels of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, and gentamicin. The study also explores the impact of cleaning practices, the materials of cooking utensils, and the potential economic consequences of foodborne illnesses. The results underscore the urgent need for improved sanitation measures and provide insights into the health risks posed by wild meat consumption. They also serve as a foundation for comparative studies and the development of region-specific interventions. Following safe handling and cooking guidelines is critical to safeguarding public health and mitigating the risks associated with food-borne diseases, particularly in regions where wild meat is a significant part of the diet.

40240714,2025,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dual-wavelength photobiomodulation (PBMT) compared with antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin on postoperatory healing and symptoms after third molar extraction. Sixty patients were randomly allocated in a parallel model according to the adjunctive therapy applied after extraction of all 4 third molars in one single session (n = 15): CTR: no adjunctive therapy; ATB3: amoxicillin for 3 days; ATB7: amoxicillin for 7 days; PBMT: PBMT at dual wavelengths (lambda 660 nm and lambda 808 nm, 200 mW). Clinical analyses (assessment of oedema, mouth opening variation, and soft tissue healing) and patient-centred analyses (application of a visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess pain, inflammation, bleeding, difficulty during opening the mouth, and chewing) were performed at 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90 days after the surgical procedure. Radiographic analysis was performed to evaluate bone repair by observing the radiographic density and fractal dimension immediately and 90 days after tooth extraction. PBMT reduced the loss of mouth opening amplitude and the sensation of pain and oedema. There were no differences between the ATB and CTR groups. PBMT has a beneficial effect on postoperative control (reduction in inflammation and pain) after third molar extraction, and ATB does not have a beneficial effect on postoperative control after these surgeries.

40239747,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Children who undergo cardiac surgery are prone to postoperative infections for which amoxicillin-clavulanate is a cornerstone antibiotic. Nevertheless, amoxicillin-clavulanate pharmacokinetics have not been studied in infants and children after cardiac surgery so far. Antibiotic exposure might be highly variable in this population due to the impact of growth, maturation, and specific pathophysiological and surgery-induced alterations. The objective of this study was to develop evidence-based amoxicillin-clavulanate dosing recommendations based on population pharmacokinetic analysis and probability of target attainment simulations in children after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Critically ill children (aged 1 day to 15 y) who underwent cardiac surgery and who were treated postoperatively with amoxicillin-clavulanate (30-60 mg/kg/6 h based on the amoxicillin component, infused in 30 min) were included. Up to five amoxicillin and clavulanate blood samples were collected per dose at predefined sampling times. Population pharmacokinetics analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling software NONMEM. RESULTS: We collected 316 amoxicillin and 287 clavulanate blood samples from 37 patients. A three-compartment model for amoxicillin and a two-compartment model for clavulanate best described pharmacokinetics, with allometric weight scaling and maturation functions added a priori to scale for size and age. Clearance estimates were remarkably high, except in patients receiving vasopressors, which decreased clearance of amoxicillin-clavulanate by a third. Using a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target of 50%fT>MIC of 8 mg/L, patients not on vasopressors warranted 4-hourly dosing to achieve adequate drug exposure due to augmented amoxicillin clearance. Only in patients treated with vasopressors was the standard 6-hourly dosing regimen sufficient to attain amoxicillin concentrations above the MIC for half of the dosing interval. CONCLUSIONS: Current amoxicillin-clavulanate dosing regimens for critically ill children after cardiac surgery need to be updated to avoid subtherapeutic concentrations and clinical failure due to augmented clearance (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02456974).","[('postoperative infections', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Critically ill', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('critically ill', 'DISEASE')]"
40237753,2025,"AIM: To determine the trends of primary antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from patients living in Moscow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of a clinical and laboratory study, 123 gastric biopsy specimens from H. pylori-infected patients were analyzed from 2015 to 2024. H. pylori infection was verified by a rapid urease test and a (13)C-urease breath test. The anaerobic culture technique was used. After identifying a pure culture, its susceptibility to four antibacterial agents (amoxicillin - AMC, clarithromycin - CLR, metronidazole - MET, tetracycline - TET) was determined by the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: According to the data, the resistance in the overall pool (n=123) of the test samples to AMC was 4.88%, CLR 16.26%, TET 3.25%, and MET 46.34%. Dual resistance to CLR and MET was detected in 4.06% of strains. Among strains collected from 2015 to 2019 (n=28), resistance to AMC was 0.0%, CLR 10.71%, TET 0.0%, and MET 50.0%. The structure of antibiotic resistance of strains collected from 2020 to 2024 (n=95) was as follows: AMC - 6.32%, CLR - 17.89%, TET - 4.21%, MET - 45.26%.

This study aimed to evaluate the risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) after first-trimester exposure to macrolides compared with amoxicillin, focusing on specific MCM subtypes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This nationwide cohort study used data from the Mother-Child EPI-MERES Register nested in the French Health Data System (SNDS). Pregnancies linked with their singleton live-born infants from January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020, were included. The macrolide exposure group comprised pregnancies with one or more prescriptions filled for systemic macrolides (erythromycin, spiramycin, roxithromycin, josamycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin) during the first trimester. The comparator group comprised pregnancies exposed to amoxicillin during the first trimester. Adjusted relative risks (aRR) and 95% CI were estimated by log-binomial regression for any MCM overall and individual MCMs with a prevalence of at least one per 10,000 live-born infants in the macrolide exposure group. Among 7,644,579 eligible pregnancies, 140,708 exposed to macrolides and 592,652 exposed to amoxicillin were included. After adjustment for measured confounders, macrolide exposure during the first trimester was not associated with any MCM overall (aRR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05) compared with amoxicillin. Specifically, no increased risk was found for most individual MCMs. However, an increase in the risk for spina bifida (aRR 1.82, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.71) and syndactyly (aRR 1.65, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.58) was observed. The adjusted risk difference per 10,000 live-born infants was 1.15 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.05) for spina bifida and 0.87 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.72) for syndactyly. Sensitivity analyses consistently yielded elevated point estimates for these two MCMs, despite wide confidence intervals and small numbers of events. Residual confounding by indication is possible. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that macrolide exposure during the first trimester is not strongly associated with an increased risk for most individual MCMs, which is reassuring. However, an increased risk of spina bifida and syndactyly remains possible.

We sought to describe the distribution of oral antibiotic formulation administration among children in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center study of children presenting to a pediatric ED. We included encounters for children (<18 years) discharged from the ED between 2016 and 2022 and prescribed one of 7 common antibiotics in oral suspension or tablet/capsule forms, excluding children with an enteral feeding tube or complex neuromuscular conditions. We analyzed encounters for children administered an antibiotic in the ED and antibiotic prescriptions. We determined the age at which the proportion of children given a tablet or capsule equaled or exceeded the proportion of those given a suspension. RESULTS: We identified 12,900 eligible encounters (median age: 4.3 years, interquartile range: 1.7 to 8.1 years; 51.5% boys). The most common diagnoses were infectious ear disorders (22.6%), infectious mouth and throat disorders (9.1﻿%), infectious skin, dermatologic and soft tissue disorders (6.6﻿%), and infectious nose and sinus disorders (6.2%). For all antibiotics administered in the ED (n = 3809 encounters; 52.6% for amoxicillin), the age threshold at which more children were prescribed the tablet/capsule than the suspension formulation was 14 years. This threshold for each antibiotic was 16 years for amoxicillin, 13 years for amoxicillin-clavulanate, 11 years for azithromycin, 14 years for cefdinir, 12 years for cephalexin, 11 years for clindamycin, and 10 years for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Findings were similar for encounters discharged from the ED with an antibiotic prescription. CONCLUSIONS: We identified age-related differences in antibiotic formulations in a pediatric ED. These findings can inform prescribing practices to optimize medication adherence and treatment effectiveness through clinical decision support and shared decision-making and may be especially useful during periods of formulation shortages or when planning for clinical research.","[('tablet/capsule', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infectious ear disorders', 'DISEASE'), ('infectious mouth', 'DISEASE'), ('throat disorders', 'DISEASE'), ('sinus disorders', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefdinir', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalexin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40223125,2025,"BACKGROUND: Shewanella putrefaciens is a Gram negative, facultatively anerobic bacterium commonly found in aquatic environments and is associated with decomposing organic matter. Although typically nonpathogenic, it has been recognized as an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing rare infections in humans, particularly immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying health conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 74-year-old white Italian female who developed a soft tissue infection after sustaining a leg injury and subsequently bathing in the coastal waters of Valencia, Spain. Despite initial treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and wound debridement, the infection persisted. Microbiological analysis revealed the presence of Shewanella putrefaciens and Bacteroides fragilis. The patient required a second-line antibiotic regimen with ciprofloxacin, which successfully resolved the infection, although the patient experienced chronic ankle edema owing to underlying lymphatic insufficiency. CONCLUSION: This case underscores several critical considerations: the emerging pathogenic potential of S. putrefaciens, the implications of environmental antibiotic resistance, and the increased risk of such infections in the context of global warming and rising sea temperatures. With climate change contributing to warmer aquatic environments, the proliferation of marine bacteria, such as S. putrefaciens, may lead to a growing number of opportunistic infections, emphasizing the need for vigilance in both clinical and environmental health settings.","[('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('leg injury', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('chronic ankle edema', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('opportunistic infections', 'DISEASE')]"
40221679,2025,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to global health, exacerbated by the protective mechanisms of biofilms formed by drug-resistant bacteria. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bacteria in biofilms serve as a formidable shield, impeding the efficacy of antimicrobial agents. Here, we investigated the potential of vitamin C (sodium ascorbate) to disrupt biofilm formation in drug-resistant bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients and studied the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of vitamin C on these bacteria. RESULTS: Out of 117 study isolates, primarily identified as Escherichia coli (n = 52), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 19), and Klebsiella spp. (n = 46), 80 isolates exhibited a Multiple Antimicrobial Resistance (MAR) index greater than 0.2, classifying them as multi-drug resistant (MDR) superbugs. Among these, 58 isolates demonstrated moderate to strong biofilm-forming abilities and were selected for further experiments with vitamin C. The effective concentration of vitamin C inhibiting the growth of most E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates (90%) was estimated at 1.25 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml respectively, while for allStaphylococcus spp. isolates, it was 0.325 mg/ml. Vitamin C exhibited a notable anti-biofilm effect against the studied isolates, with biofilm prevention concentrations (BPC) of 0.625, 1.25, and 0.16 mg/ml for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Staphylococcus spp. isolates respectively. Furthermore, when combined with oxacillin or amoxicillin - drugs that were found ineffective, vitamin C significantly reduced the ability of MDR isolates to form biofilms, rendering them susceptible to the drugs' effects and restoring their efficacy. The expression of the recA gene, an early and quantifiable marker for the onset of the SOS response and biofilm production was downregulated after treatment of E. coli with vitamin C. Relative gene expression analysis revealed that ciprofloxacin-induced recA expression was significantly inhibited when MDR isolates of E. coli were treated with vitamin C at a concentration of 0.625 mg/ml, the BPC of vitamin C. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that vitamin C, alone or in combination with ineffective antibiotics, attenuates biofilm formation and restores the susceptibility of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates to antimicrobial agents. This study underscores the promise of vitamin C as a non-lethal disruptor of biofilm-associated antimicrobial resistance.

Methods: A cross-sectional pilot study was carried out using questionnaires addressed to the three groups of interest: patients (n = 250), students (n = 79) and professors (n = 50). Sociodemographic questions were asked of all the groups. The professor and student questions were related to antibiotic therapy in relation to dental procedures. The patients were asked questions related to antibiotic management. Results: Regarding the patient group, there were statistically significant differences between the participants of the group; people without higher education were more likely to self-medicate (p = 0.043) or to be unaware of the adverse effects (p = 0.045). Regarding the student and professor groups, there were no significant differences in the prescription of antibiotics. Amoxicillin 750 mg was the most commonly used in patients without an allergy to Penicillin, but there were significant differences in the antibiotic of choice for those patients allergic to Penicillin, the most commonly prescribed being either Clindamycin or Azithromycin (p = 0.002). Conclusions: The study revealed a lack of uniformity in the knowledge and management of antibiotics among both students and professors, which highlights the need to improve university training in pharmacology and for professors to continue education throughout their working lives. It also indicates the need for patient health education regarding antibiotics.","[('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('allergy', 'DISEASE'), ('Penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('allergic', 'DISEASE'), ('Penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40217218,2025,"BACKGROUND: Mature cystic teratomas, a common type of benign ovarian tumors, are associated with complications such as twisting and tumor rupture; Rupture can cause severe chemical peritonitis, and no management policy has been established for the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Although peritoneal lavage and reoperation have been reported, the optimal treatment approach remains undetermined. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old woman (gravida 0, para 0, and no sexual history) presented with abdominal pain and fever. Blood examination revealed high levels of WBC 9200/microL and CRP 23.7 mg/dL, although hemoglobin was normal. Serum tumor marker levels were also elevated (CA125 58.5 U/mL, CA19-9 36117 U/mL). Abdominal computed tomography revealed bilateral ovarian tumors (92 and 68 mm in the right and left ovaries, respectively). Each tumor cavity had calcification with increased fatty tissue density. We performed laparoscopic surgery for suspected diagnosis of torsion or rupture of a mature cystic teratoma. Intraoperative findings showed spontaneous rupture followed by chemical peritonitis. Therefore, we performed removal of the bilateral adnexal tumors and peritoneal lavage with 3000 mL warm saline to remove fatty components from the abdominal cavity. We also inserted an intra-abdominal drain to remove the residual fatty components. Amoxicillin was also administered for 10 days after surgery. The inflammatory response decreased, and the fever diminished 1 day postoperatively. The patient was discharged on the 10th postoperative day. However, on the 20th postoperative day, the fever and abdominal pain recurred. WBC 16,700/microL, CRP 26.46 mg/dL and tumor marker (CA125 172.3 U/mL, CA19-9 225.2 U/mL) levels were high. Intravenous administration of Prophylactic antibiotics was initiated. As no bacteria were detected in the blood cultures, we started oral prednisolone (5 mg/day) to treat the recurrent chemical peritonitis-induced inflammation. The blood test results and symptoms gradually improved. The patient was discharged on the 37th postoperative day. CONCLUSION: To date, no systematic review has focused on determining the treatment strategy for bilateral rupture of mature cystic teratomas and severe refractory chemical peritonitis. Treating the patient with laparoscopic surgery at the first occurrence and oral steroids for peritonitis recurrence can help avoid highly invasive treatments, such as reoperation or laparotomy.","[('teratomas', 'DISEASE'), ('ovarian tumors', 'DISEASE'), ('tumor', 'DISEASE'), ('peritonitis', 'DISEASE'), ('abdominal pain', 'DISEASE'), ('fever', 'DISEASE'), ('tumor', 'DISEASE'), ('36117', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ovarian tumors', 'DISEASE'), ('tumor', 'DISEASE'), ('calcification', 'DISEASE'), ('fatty', 'DISEASE'), ('torsion', 'DISEASE'), ('cystic teratoma', 'DISEASE'), ('peritonitis', 'DISEASE'), ('adnexal tumors', 'DISEASE'), ('fatty', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fever', 'DISEASE'), ('fever', 'DISEASE'), ('abdominal pain', 'DISEASE'), ('tumor', 'DISEASE'), ('prednisolone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('peritonitis-induced inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('teratomas', 'DISEASE'), ('peritonitis', 'DISEASE'), ('steroids', 'CHEMICAL'), ('peritonitis', 'DISEASE')]"

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Dutch outpatient setting in 2022. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 407 authorised medicinal products for 10 pharmaceutical substances with the largest number of outpatients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The diversity of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and finished pharmaceutical product (FPP) manufacturers, their geographic locations and the interdependencies between these manufacturers and marketing authorisation holders (MAHs). RESULTS: For the 407 authorised medicinal products, 50 of the 90 API manufacturing sites were in Asia, and 38 were in Europe. For five pharmaceutical substances, most of the API sites were located outside Europe. Of the 128 FPP manufacturing sites, 94 were in Europe and 31 in Asia. For all 10 substances, at least 47% of FPP sites were located in Europe. API manufacturing for 122 of the 407 products (30%) was entirely performed outside Europe, and FPP manufacturing for 66 of the 407 products (16%). For four substances, more than half of the products depended on API manufacturing outside Europe. The number of distinct API and FPP manufacturing sites per substance was at least four. For amoxicillin, 16 of the 32 products (50%) entirely depended on one and the same API site. For omeprazole, 39 of the 85 products (46%) entirely depended on one and the same FPP site. MAHs applied dual sourcing for API and FPP manufacturing for 61 (15%) of the authorised medicinal products. For three pharmaceutical substances, none of the authorised medicinal products listed at least two API and FPP manufacturing sites.

40208563,2025,"Canine urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in veterinary practice and often have a complex etiology. Typically, diagnoses rely on classical phenotypic tests or are limited to identifying the genus of the pathogen. Treatments are frequently administered without prior in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing. This study analyzed 389 urine samples from dogs with clinical signs of UTI, collected by cystocentesis, through microbiological culture. Species-level identification of bacteria and yeasts was performed using mass spectrometry, while bacterial isolates underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing via the disk diffusion method. Of the 389 samples, 170 (43.7%) showed microbial growth, with 192 microorganisms identified. Among these, 98.4% (189/192) were bacteria, and 1.6% (3/192) were fungi/yeasts.

40208479,2025,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitors are often used to treat aspiration pneumonia in patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest (CA). The impact of hypothermic temperature control on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMO/CLAV) and ampicillin/sulbactam (AMP/SULB) has not been studied. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of hypothermic temperature control on the plasma and soft tissue pharmacokinetics of AMO/CLAV and AMP/SULB, including pulmonary concentrations of AMP/SULB, in patients resuscitated after CA. METHODS: This prospective clinical study involved ten adult patients after CA receiving either AMO/CLAV 2 g/0.2 g or AMP/SULB 2 g/1 g intravenously every 8 h. Patients underwent hypothermic temperature control (33 +/- 1  degrees C) for 24 h, followed by normothermia. Plasma, urine, muscle, and subcutaneous pharmacokinetics were measured and plasma protein-binding assessed for each subject. Microdialysis determined unbound drug concentrations in soft tissues. The pulmonary concentration of AMP/SULB was analyzed in the epithelial lining fluid. RESULTS: No significant differences in plasma pharmacokinetics or renal excretion of AMO/CLAV and AMP/SULB were observed between the two temperature conditions. Soft tissue concentrations showed no consistent trend. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets (time that the unbound plasma concentrations were above the minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] for MIC up to 8 mg/L) were met but not for 16 mg/L. Pulmonary concentrations of AMP/SULB in the epithelial lining fluid showed no clear trend.

40204871,2025,"BACKGROUND: Early antibiotic exposure may disrupt gut microbiome and affect the gut-lung axis. We examined the impact of prolonged antibiotic exposure during early life on growth and subsequent acute lung injury (ALI) in a rat pup model. METHODS: Thirty-four 7-day-old rat pups were divided into Control, Antibiotics (Anti), Lung injury (LI), and Antibiotics-Lung Injury (Anti-LI) groups. The Anti and Anti-LI groups received oral Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid from 7 to 40 days old, while Control and LI groups received sham water. ALI was induced in LI and Anti-LI groups with intratracheally administered lipopolysaccharide at 41 days old; all were sacrificed at 42 days old. Fecal bacterial sequencing, serum cytokine analysis, and pulmonary histological examination were performed. RESULTS: Control and LI groups showed better weight gain from day 19 compared to Anti and Anti-LI groups. Anti and Anti-ALI groups exhibited decreased fecal microbial diversity (P < 0.05) and reduced Firmicutes abundance (P < 0.05) versus Control and LI groups. No significant difference in ALI severity was found between antibiotic-treated and non-treated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged early-life antibiotic exposure in this rat pup model significantly reduced gut microbiota diversity and exhibited a non-significant trend toward lower weight gain, without exacerbating the severity of subsequent LPS-induced ALI. IMPACT: Prolonged early-life antibiotic exposure decreased gut microbial diversity in rat pups. Antibiotics-exposed groups exhibited a trend of reduced weight gain compared to controls, although the difference was not statistically significant. Despite the observed alterations in the gut microbiota, there were no significant differences in the severity of subsequent acute lung injury between the groups with and without prolonged antibiotic exposure.

Despite its significance, there is a scarcity of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data available for this organism in North America. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the AST profile and identify factors associated with H. pylori culture positivity in a cohort of patients with refractory H. pylori undergoing gastric biopsies. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed gastric biopsy specimens received for culture between July 2009 and February 2023. We analyzed specimen transport time, Gram smear results, direct urease test findings, culture positivity and AST profiles. Using gradient strip methodology and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing breakpoints, AST was conducted for amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin and tetracycline. RESULTS: Of 579 biopsy samples received for H. pylori culture, 228 (39.4%) tested positive. Samples transported within <1 h had significantly higher odds (1.81 times, P < 0.015) of being culture positive compared to those with longer transport times. Smear-positive samples had substantially higher odds (18.8 times, P < 0.001) of culture positivity compared to smear-negative. Urease-positive samples demonstrated notably higher odds (7.7 times, P < 0.001) of culture positivity compared to urease-negative samples. The collection of isolates from gastric biopsies showed susceptibility rates of 97.3% to amoxicillin, 99.1% to tetracycline, 50.4% to levofloxacin, 25.9% to metronidazole and 12.9% to clarithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Short sample transport time was associated with improved H. pylori recovery rates.

AIM: This study aimed to determine the antibacterial effect of the ethanol extract of cranberry juice (CJ) against uropathogen commonly found in urinary tract infections (UTIs) associated with pregnancy. METHODS: Cranberry fruits were purchased from local markets and juiced, filtered, and dried. The dried powder was extracted with 70% ethanol for 8-10 days. The bacterial isolates used in this study [Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus sp., and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS)] were collected from the Maternity and Children Hospital in Al-Diwaniyah City, Iraq. The antibacterial activity of the ethanol extract of CJ was measured using a standard Disc diffusion method. Sterile paper discs were soaked in 20 microl of different concentrations (12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/ml) of the extract, placed in Mueller-Hinton agar plates, and inoculated with bacterial cultures adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards. Amoxicillin (30 microg) was used as a positive control, and 70% ethanol was used as a negative control. RESULTS: The ethanol solution of CJ displayed a significant (p < 0.05) inhibitory activity against all tested bacteria. The CNS showed the highest sensitivity with 100% inhibition, followed by S. aureus (90%), Enterococcus sp. (85%), P. vulgaris (75%), and E. coli (60%). The effect was dose dependent, as increasing the extract concentration resulted in broader inhibition zones.

METHODS: Patients who failed H. pylori eradication therapy at least once were enrolled and randomly assigned into four groups (1:1:1:1), as follows: The control group received 20 mg rabeprazole, 1,000 mg amoxicillin, 220 mg bismuth potassium citrate, and 100 mg furazolidone twice daily (b.i.d.) for 14 days; Group A received 240 mg JWC b.i.d. combined with 20 mg rabeprazole, 1,000 mg amoxicillin, and 100 mg furazolidone b.i.d. for 14 days; Group B received the same regimen as Group A for 14 days, followed by an additional 14 days of 240 mg JWC b.i.d.; and Group C received 240 mg JWC b.i.d. combined with 20 mg rabeprazole, 1,000 mg amoxicillin, 220 mg bismuth potassium citrate, and 100 mg furazolidone b.i.d. for 10 days. The primary outcome was H. pylori eradication at 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-eight patients were included in this study. The intention-to-treat (ITT) eradication rates in the four groups were 85.2, 73.8, 78.7 and 75.4% (p = 0.136), while the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) eradication rates were 92.0, 84.9, 88.9 and 86.8% (p = 0.398), respectively. And the per-protocol (PP) eradication rates were 92.5, 85.4, 87.9 and 86.7% (p = 0.405), respectively. The eradication rates were comparable among the four groups. No statistically significant differences in eradication rates were observed between each of the three treatment groups and the control group (all p > 0.05). The eradication rate of H. pylori in group B demonstrated non-inferiority compared with the control group (p = 0.0415; 90% CI, -0.0965 to 0.0336). The four groups exhibited similar frequencies of overall adverse events (9.84, 5.74, 6.56%, 2.46%, p = 0.112). CONCLUSION: The eradication rate of the JWC-containing regimen demonstrated no statistically significant difference compared with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy in the rescue treatment of H. pylori infection. The prolonged JWC treatment regimen exhibited non-inferiority in eradication rates. JWC-containing therapies can effectively reduce the incidence of adverse reactions and significantly alleviate certain clinical symptoms.

Given the lack of information on the situation in livestock in Paraguay, the aim of this study was to determine the most frequent Salmonella serovars in poultry, pig and cattle sampled in slaughterhouses in the country in 2020-22 along with their AMR phenotypes using data from a national pilot program. Out of 1,161 samples collected from slaughtered animals originating from 189 farms nationwide, Salmonella was isolated from 91/384 (23.7%) samples from poultry, 52/390 (13.3%) from pigs and 6/387 (1.6%) from cattle. Seven serovars were identified in poultry, with Heidelberg being the most frequent (82.4% of 91 isolates), while the most frequent serovars in pigs were Panama (48.1%) and Typhimurium (38.5%), and only two serovars (Cerro and Braenderup) were identified in cattle. The proportion of resistant isolates ranged from extremely high (70-83% for nalidixic acid and tetracycline) and high (25-40% for nitrofurantoin and ampicilin) to low-moderate (8-18% for cefixime, cefotaxime, amoxicillin, and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole) and very low-low (<6% for ciprofloxacin and gentamicin) depending on the antimicrobial. Up to 23 different resistance profiles were found, ranging from pansusceptible (18/143 isolates) to resistance to 2-7 antimicrobials (median = 2), with the predominant serovars in poultry and swine typically being resistant to >/=3 antimicrobials.

We investigated the resistome, mobilome, and phylogenetic relationships of antibiotic-resistant E. coli and E. faecium in surface water from two cities using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Water samples (500 mL) from streams near informal settlements in Durban and Pietermaritzburg were filtered through 0.45 mum membrane filters. E. faecium and E. coli were identified on selective media and tested for antibiotic susceptibility using the VITEK(R) 2 platform. DNA was extracted from isolates for WGS to delineate the resistome, mobilome, multi-locus strain types (STs) and phylogenetic relationships using the open-source CARD, CGE, RAST, BV-BRC and PubMLST tools. Eleven E. faecium and 12 E. coli isolates were molecularly identified. Antibiotic resistance was observed in seven E. coli belonging to two STs and seven E. faecium belonging to five STs. Third and fourth-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (3/7) were found in Durban. These isolates did not harbour extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes conferring cephalosporin resistance but had the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump for multiple antibiotic resistance. E. coli harboured blaTEM-1, sul1, sul3, and dfrA12, conferring resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam and cotrimoxazole, respectively. Also, E. faecium harboured qnrB19, qnrS1, tet(A), cmlA1, aadA1 and aadA2. tet(M), tet(L), msr(C) and erm(B) conferring resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin, respectively.

The objective of this study is to provide data on diagnoses and antibiotic prescriptions among primary care patients in Harare, Zimbabwe. We conducted a retrospective study of medical records from eight primary care clinics in Harare, Zimbabwe. Clinics were selected based on the population they served and the availability of records. Patient consultations conducted between January 2016 and December 2022 were included. Antibiotic prescriptions were categorised into groups according to the AWaRe (Access, Watch and Reserve) classification. During the study period, 199,880 patient consultations were recorded. The median patient age was 9 years and 52.5% (105,035/199,880) were female. The most common causes of presentation were due to infectious diseases including, in order of frequency, gastroenteritis (15.2%; 30,352/199,880), acute respiratory infections (10.9%; 21,381/199,880) and pneumonia (10.5%; 20,889/199,880). Overall, antibiotics were prescribed in 70.5% (117,674/166,858) of patients who were not referred to hospital. Antibiotics commonly prescribed were amoxicillin (39.4%; 65,825/166,858), ciprofloxacin (10.3%; 17,162/166,858), metronidazole (9.4%; 15,681/166,858).

Subjects were assigned at random to either the group for 10-day or 14-day, and where given vonoprazan 20 mg bid and amoxicillin 1 g tid. Comparisons were made in terms of eradication rates, adverse events, cost-effectiveness, and compliance. RESULTS: 914 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the 10-day or 14-day VA groups. Using the intention-to-treat principle and multiple imputation for missing outcomes, the analysis showed an eradication rate of 88.79% in the 10-day group and 92.37% in the 14-day group (P = 0.064). The eradication rates were 89.14% and 93.35% by per-protocol analysis (P = 0.037). There were no significant differences in adverse events or compliance between the groups (P > 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that smoking and prior failure of eradication were risk factors influencing the eradication rate (P < 0.05). For the economic evaluation, the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of the 10-day group was 426.30 yuan, the CER of the 14-day group was 485.27 yuan, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 1680.23 yuan. In probability sensitivity analysis, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that when the willingness-to-pay(WTP) threshold was below 1742 yuan, the 10-day group was more cost-effective. When the WTP threshold was above 1742 yuan, the 14-day group was more cost-effective. CONCLUSION: In this study, the 10-day VA was not found to be inferior to the 14-day VA. Compared with the 14-day group, the 10-day group is more cost-effective, but as the WTP threshold increases to 1742 yuan, the probability of the 14-day group being more cost-effective was greater than that of the 10-day group.

40192057,2025,"The global prevalence of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD) has a rising trend. The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory assumes that MAFLD develops throughout the entire lifecycle but it originates in early life. This study aimed to investigate the influence of early-life gut microbiota colonization on the susceptibility to adulthood hepatic lipid accumulation in high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice. The results showed that perinatal AM exposure exacerbated adulthood hepatic lipid accumulation and altered hepatic lipid profile in HFD-fed male but not female offspring. Perinatal AM exposure does not affect hepatic lipid metabolic genes in adult offspring. Instead, perinatal AM exposure inhibited intestinal bile acid (BA) metabolism to reduce secondary BAs production, thereby promoting dietary lipid absorption. Mechanistically, perinatal AM exposure permanently reduces species diversity of the microbial community and impairs its structure and function by disrupting early-life gut microbiota colonization. Supplementing Lactobacillus during lactation improved gut microbiota colonization and intestinal BA metabolism, thereby alleviating HFD-induced hepatic lipid deposition. These results suggest that disruption of early-life gut microbiota colonization elevates susceptibility to adulthood hepatic lipid accumulation by promoting intestinal lipid absorption in HFD-fed mice. Supplementing probiotics during lactation may be an effective strategy for preventing susceptibility to adulthood MAFLD.","[('Fatty Liver Disease', 'DISEASE'), ('early-life', 'DISEASE'), ('intestinal bile acid', 'DISEASE')]"

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 278 patients diagnosed with PJI from January 2019 to December 2024 at our institution was performed. Demographic characteristics of the patients, the distribution of pathogenic bacteria, and data on antibiotic resistance were statistically analyzed employing the chi-square test and t-test. RESULTS: Gram-positive cocci comprised 56.6% of all pathogenic bacteria, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci constituted 28.1% of the total. Throughout the study period, a significant decrease was observed in the proportion of rifampicin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), from 27.0% to 10.4%. Similarly, a marked decline was noted in the proportion of gentamicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, from 50.0% to 15.4%. Conversely, there was a dramatic increase in the proportion of amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant gram-negative bacilli, from 23.1% to 64.7%. The incidence of fungal infections was notably higher among diabetic patients with PJI compared to their non-diabetic counterparts. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the distribution pattern of pathogenic bacteria and their antibiotic resistance profiles among patients with PJI undergoes continuous variation. Moreover, there exist significant differences in the distribution of pathogenic bacteria between those with diabetes and those without diabetes among PJI patients. This serves as a crucial theoretical foundation and empirical support for the rigorous and tailored development of anti-infective treatment strategies for patients with various types of PJI.","[('periprosthetic joint infection', 'DISEASE'), ('PJI', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetic', 'DISEASE'), ('PJI', 'DISEASE'), ('PJI', 'DISEASE'), ('gentamicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant gram-negative bacilli', 'DISEASE'), ('fungal infections', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetic', 'DISEASE'), ('PJI', 'DISEASE'), ('PJI', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetes', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetes', 'DISEASE'), ('PJI', 'DISEASE'), ('PJI', 'DISEASE')]"
40181762,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication rates are higher by treated with the potassium-competitive acid blocker vonorasan than with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Herein, this study analyzed the clinical efficacy of vonoprazan combined with high-dose amoxicillin for dual therapy in personalized eradication of HP. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 452 patients with type I HP who were assigned to the observation and control groups. Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) antibodies were detected using the H. pylori antibody typing classification assay kit by Western blot. The control group underwent PPI quadruple therapy (oral administration of esomeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and colloidal bismuth subcitrate). The observation group was treated with vonoprazan combined with high-dose amoxicillin orally. The clinical efficacy was evaluated after 14 days of treatment, and adverse reactions during treatment were compared. The eradication rates for different HP types in the two groups were detected using a (13)C-urea breath test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the control and observation groups in sex, age, BMI, disease duration, smoking history, or drinking history. The observation group exhibited higher total effective rates and better eradication effects than the control group. The CagA(+), VacA(+), or CagA(+)VacA(+) type patients showed no statistical difference in the incidence of adverse reactions, but the observation group showed a lower total incidence of adverse reactions than the control group. CONCLUSION: Vonoprazan combined with high-dose amoxicillin has better clinical efficacy and eradication effect for patients with CagA(+)VacA(+) HP, along with reduced adverse reactions.","[('high-dose amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('VacA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('quadruple', 'CHEMICAL'), ('esomeprazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colloidal bismuth subcitrate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('high-dose amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('reduced adverse reactions', 'DISEASE')]"
40178062,2025,"BACKGROUND: Treatment is indicated for all Helicobacter pylori infections. However, the best approach for H. pylori management remains unclear. METHODS: H. pylori eradication data from Hp-EuReg on treatment-naive patients in Slovenia from 2013 to 2023 were included. The regimens prescribed, the number of eradication attempts, effectiveness, adherence, and safety were analyzed. The effectiveness was assessed by modified intention to treat (mITT). RESULTS: Eight Slovenian medical institutions contributed data for 4016 treatment-naive patients to Hp-EuReg. Of these, 18% did not undergo confirmatory post-treatment; most who did received a urea breath test. Between 2013 and 2018, 7-day triple therapy with amoxicillin and clarithromycin was most frequently used in first-line treatment, with an 88% eradication rate. From 2019 to 2023, a 14-day high-dose PPI (esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d.) triple therapy with amoxicillin and clarithromycin was used, showing a significantly higher effectiveness at 94% (p < 0.05). Quadruple bismuth-based therapy (esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d., plus amoxicillin 500 mg, metronidazole 400 mg, and bismuth 120 mg, all q.i.d.) provided a 96.9% eradication rate, though this was not significantly better than the 14-day triple regimen. The H. pylori resistance rate to clarithromycin was 16% from 2013 to 2018, dropping to 13.5% from 2019 to 2023. Side effects were reported by 9.6% of patients, and treatment compliance was > 99%. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that systematic data collection from routine clinical practice in Hp-EuReg can guide first-line H. pylori treatment. Established 90% treatment effectiveness threshold may serve as a surrogate marker for monitoring H. pylori resistance rates to antibiotics. In countries with a H. pylori resistance rate < 15%, such as Slovenia, the 14-day high-dose PPI amoxicillin-clarithromycin regimen is an optimal first-line empirical treatment.

40177837,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Mycobacterium abscessus is the most frequent of the rapidly growing mycobacteria responsible for lung infections in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis and COPD. Imipenem is currently recommended in the treatment of these infections in spite of beta-lactamase production. Since the targets of beta-lactams include transpeptidases of both the l,d and d,d specificities, we tested, in vitro, intracellularly and in vivo, a combination of two beta-lactams active on these enzymes, amoxicillin and imipenem, alone or in combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitor relebactam. METHODS: Drug combinations were evaluated against M. abscessus CIP 104536T and clinical isolates (n = 35) by determining MICs, FIC indices and time-killing. Drug combinations were also evaluated in macrophages and in mice. RESULTS: In the presence of relebactam, synergy between amoxicillin and imipenem was observed against both M. abscessus CIP 104536T and the clinical isolates. Against M. abscessus CIP 104536T, the addition of 1 mg/L imipenem and 4 mg/L relebactam led to a decrease in the MIC of amoxicillin from 64 to 1 mg/L. The triple combination was active in vitro and intracellularly (a 4.30 decrease in the log10 cfu/mL and 82% killing, respectively). The triple combination was effective in reducing log10 cfu in mouse organs and mouse spleen weights, and in preventing losses in mouse weights. CONCLUSIONS: The amoxicillin/imipenem/relebactam combination was synergistic in vitro and effective in vivo against M. abscessus. Since these drugs are clinically available, the triple combination should be considered by clinicians and further evaluated based on the reporting of the patient outcomes.","[('Mycobacterium abscessus', 'DISEASE'), ('lung infections', 'DISEASE'), ('fibrosis', 'DISEASE'), ('COPD', 'DISEASE'), ('Imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('abscessus CIP 104536T', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('abscessus CIP 104536T', 'DISEASE'), ('abscessus CIP 104536T', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) were searched published from establishment of database to June 1, 2024, for articles studying VA dual therapy compared to BQT for patients with H. pylori infection. Meta-analyses of eradication rates, adverse events, compliance and cost were preformed. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies were included for meta-analysis. Compared with BQT, VA increased the incidence of H. pylori eradication rate, with significant difference under the ITT analysis (86.9% vs. 80.4%, RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.12, p = 0.01) but there no significant difference under the PP analysis (90.7% vs. 86.5%, RR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.99-1.08, p = 0.13). Besides, VA significantly increased compliance (RR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p < 0.01) and decreased the occurrence of total adverse events (27.0% vs. 11.5%, RR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.37-0.51, p < 0.01). Furthermore, VA has lower cost compared to BQT. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that VA dual therapy provided a higher eradication rate, enhanced compliance, decreased adverse events, and lowered cost relative to BQT for patients with H. pylori infection.

40174543,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Gender differences affect exposure to infections, including drug-resistant ones. However, data on the relationship between gender and antibiotic use are limited. This systematic review examines gender differences in antibiotic prescribing patterns in community and primary care settings. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: We searched Web of Science (Core Collection), PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Database, and EMBASE for studies published between January 2014 and April 2024. We included studies of any design that analyzed antibiotic prescribing patterns for patients consulting general practitioners. We excluded studies that did not examine gender differences, unpublished reports, and non-English articles. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings. The review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023476119). RESULTS: Our search identified 12,853 citations, from which we included 11 studies conducted in 10 countries. Most studies (n = 7) were cross-sectional. Gender analysis of antibiotic prescribing in the included studies did not show a consistent pattern in the likelihood of antibiotic prescription based on gender. The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were azithromycin, amoxicillin, cephalexins, penicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole, primarily for respiratory infections, sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, COVID-19, skin, and musculoskeletal diseases. Most studies did not report dose compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review identifies gender as a factor in antibiotic prescribing that remains insufficiently explored.

40172204,2025,"Clostridioides difficile is a known cause of diarrhea and colitis in human and non-human animals. While C. difficile is regularly isolated from domesticated horses, little is known about its prevalence in wild or feral populations. In Australia, the horse population encompasses a mix of both domesticated and feral animals, with the feral population of 400,000 estimated to be the largest in the world. This study investigated the presence and characteristics of C. difficile in Australian feral horses and evaluated their potential as a source or reservoir of C. difficile in the wider community. Fecal samples (n = 380) were collected from free-roaming feral horses from five Australian jurisdictions and cultured for C. difficile. Isolates were characterized by PCR ribotyping and toxin profiling. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for fidaxomicin, vancomycin, metronidazole, rifaximin, clindamycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, meropenem, and tetracycline. C. difficile was isolated from 45 of the 380 samples (11.8%)-one-third of that seen in recent studies on Australian domesticated horses but consistent with wild animal species worldwide. Forty ribotypes (RTs) were identified, 28 of which (70%) were novel; other RTs had been previously reported in humans, livestock, and soils. Eighteen toxigenic C. difficile strains were isolated, of which eight contain binary toxin genes. Strains were largely susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested. This investigation provides preliminary information on C. difficile in feral horses in Australia and allows a comparison with their domestic counterparts. The findings support the hypothesis that all horse feces represent a potential source of C. difficile in the community. IMPORTANCE: Clostridioides difficile poses an ongoing threat to healthcare in the community, with increasing evidence of transmission outside the hospital setting. In keeping with a One Health model of dispersion, investigations into this microorganism within the wider environment are vital to understanding this evolving epidemiology. Australia has the biggest population of feral horses in the world, and this study of C. difficile in feral horses provides insight into the role of non-domesticated animals in the dissemination of C. difficile. Examination of prevalence and characterization of isolates provides a baseline for evaluating the effect of antimicrobials and other factors associated with domestication on equine C. difficile infection.","[('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('colitis', 'DISEASE'), ('fidaxomicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifaximin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('moxifloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('equine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('difficile infection', 'DISEASE')]"

The chronic inflammation associated with periodontitis also worsens conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Treatment approaches have evolved in response, incorporating local and systemic antimicrobials as adjuncts to traditional mechanical debridement. This literature review explores the role of antimicrobials in periodontal therapy, examining the efficacy of systemic and local options as adjuncts to mechanical debridement. Findings suggest that systemic antimicrobials, especially amoxicillin-metronidazole combinations, benefit aggressive periodontitis cases; their use should be limited to specific, severe cases to mitigate antimicrobial resistance risks. Local antimicrobials provide a more targeted treatment option with reduced systemic side effects, which is particularly useful in managing localized infections. Adjunctive local antimicrobials with scaling and root planning (SRP) significantly reduced probing pocket depths (PPDs) and improved clinical attachment levels (CALs) in periodontal treatment with minimal adverse effects. Tetracycline fibers, minocycline, and doxycycline were most effective in PPD reduction, while chlorhexidine showed the greatest CAL gains. Further research is essential to establish clear guidelines and long-term outcomes in antimicrobial use for periodontal disease management.","[('Periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetes', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aggressive periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('Tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('minocycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chlorhexidine', 'CHEMICAL')]"

This study aims to examine patterns of infections and associated antibiotic use in children attending Primary Health Centers (PHCs), including an explanatory analysis of antibiotics for non-pneumonia acute respiratory infections (ARIs), pneumonia, and diarrhea. METHODOLOGY: An observational study used records of all children  5 years of age prescribed antibiotics from January 2019 to December 2020 in selected PHCs in Surabaya and Banjarmasin, Indonesia. Data on children's characteristics, diagnoses, and antibiotics prescribed, were collected from patient records. The explanatory analysis was based on national guidelines. A descriptive analysis was used to summarize the data. RESULTS: A total of 1053 and 1463 children's records with antibiotics were located at Surabaya and Banjarmasin PHCs, respectively. ARIs were the most common indications for antibiotic prescribing in both settings, either non-pneumonia ARIs (60.6% versus 33.8%, respectively) or pneumonia (20.2% versus 25.2%, respectively). High conformity with guidelines were evident for antibiotics used for pneumonia (i.e., amoxicillin/cotrimoxazole/erythromycin - 89.3%) or specified upper ARIs (e.g., amoxicillin for pharyngitis - 73.9%), and for diarrhea (i.e., cotrimoxazole - 73.1%). However, some information, such as diagnoses, were not recorded or were unspecific, hence limiting assessment. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided insights into prescribing antibiotics among children in Indonesia. Lack of specific guidelines for children and inadequate documentation for antibiotic prescribing warrants improvement.

This prospective study aimed to evaluate the eradication efficacy of high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) with esomeprazole and amoxicillin in a region with high resistance rates to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin. METHODOLOGY: A total of 82 patients with active H. pylori infection, confirmed by either a rapid urease test or a (1)(3)C urea breath test, were enrolled at our hospital. All participants received esomeprazole (40 mg) and amoxicillin (1,000 mg), 3 times daily for 14 days. Treatment success was assessed using a (1)(3)C urea breath test 4-6 weeks post-treatment. Safety was evaluated based on reported adverse effects. RESULTS: Gastritis, gastric ulcer, and duodenal ulcer were present in 80.5%, 10.4%, and 9.1% of cases, respectively. The eradication rates according to intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were 76.8% (63/82) and 81.8% (63/77), respectively. In the PP analysis, the eradication rate was 86.0% (49/57) in first-line treatment, and 70.0% (14/20) in patients with prior H. pylori treatment failure. Mild side effects, including nausea, abdominal discomfort, pruritus, diarrhea, and fatigue, were reported in 22.1% (17/77) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a 14-day HDDT regimen provides relatively high efficacy and a favorable safety profile for first-line H. pylori eradication.

40166923,2025,"INTRODUCTION/AIMS: The true frequency and severity of myasthenia gravis (MG) exacerbation associated with the usage of fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotics remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the association between ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, azithromycin, and MG exacerbation. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on MG patients seen at a single institution between 2002 and 2022, who received ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or azithromycin. Amoxicillin usage was chosen for comparison. The strength of association between antibiotic usage and MG exacerbation was scored using the Adverse Drug Reactions Probability Scale. A mixed-effects logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate predictors of antibiotic-associated MG exacerbation (AAMGE). RESULTS: 365 patients had a total of 918 episodes of antibiotic usage (n = 339 for ciprofloxacin, n = 187 for levofloxacin, n = 392 for azithromycin). Frequencies of MG exacerbation following antibiotic use were: 8 (2.4%) for ciprofloxacin, 3 (1.6%) for levofloxacin, 6 (1.5%) for azithromycin, and 17 (1.9%) for all. Six patients had impending crisis/crisis, and 9 required rescue therapy. MG exacerbation was associated with MG-related hospitalization or ED visit in the preceding 6 months (p = 0.012), female sex (p = 0.023) and diabetes (p = 0.032). Infection was the most common confounder in exacerbations (88.2%). MG exacerbation was seen in 8/603 (1.3%) episodes of amoxicillin use, without a significant difference in frequencies of AAMGE among the four antibiotics (p = 0.68). DISCUSSION: Usage of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or azithromycin was associated with MG exacerbation in less than 2.5% of episodes of antibiotic use. Underlying infection may play a role in AAMGE. As AAMGE can be severe, decision-making regarding the use of these antibiotics should be individualized.","[('myasthenia gravis', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('macrolide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('antibiotic-associated', 'DISEASE'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MG-related', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetes', 'DISEASE'), ('Infection', 'DISEASE'), ('exacerbations', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('AAMGE', 'CHEMICAL')]"

40164424,2025,"Volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) and sulfur-containing antibiotic wastewater are pervasive environmental pollutants that pose significant risks to atmospheric and aquatic ecosystems. Traditional photocatalysts often lack the versatility to simultaneously address multiple pollutants, highlighting the need for multifunctional materials. A novel FeUiO-66-NH(2)@b-TiO(2) composite with a Z-scheme heterojunction has been developed as a highly efficient and tunable visible-light photocatalyst for the degradation of both VSCs and sulfur-containing antibiotics. The composite was synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal method, and its photocatalytic performance was optimized by varying the ratio of FeUiO-66-NH(2) to b-TiO(2). The Z-scheme heterojunction facilitates effective separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, significantly enhancing the material's photocatalytic activity. The material's structure and photoresponse were evaluated using XRD and FTIR. Under visible light, the composite exhibited remarkable degradation performance. For example, FU1T6 achieved complete degradation of CH(3)SH within 20 min, while FU3T1 degraded 90 % of the antibiotic cefixime within 140 min. Moreover, the material demonstrated excellent degradation efficiency for other cephalosporins and amoxicillin, proving its broad-spectrum capability for sulfur-containing antibiotics. This study highlights the FeUiO-66-NH(2)@b-TiO(2) composite as a promising candidate for the treatment of complex environmental pollutants, including odorous gases and antibiotic wastewater.

Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated species 71.4% (50/70) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae 10% (7/70), Enterobacter cloacae 5.7% (4/70, Proteus mirabilis 4.3% (3/70), Enterococcus faecalis 2.9% (3/70), Acinetobacter baumannii 2.9% (3/70), Lelliottia amnigena 1.4% (1/70) and Streptococcus agalactiae 1.4% (1/70). All 50 biochemically confirmed E. coli isolates were also confirmed using uspA gene. Three resistance genes TEM, SHV and CTX-M were detected using polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: E. coli was the most frequently isolated species followed by K. pneumoniae, this result may indicate that K. pneumoniae is becoming increasingly common as an etiological agent of UTI. A high resistance toward Amoxicillin- Clavulanic Acid was found among E. coli isolates, while multiple antibiotic/drug resistance was 62%. These results highlight the need to adhere to the therapeutic guidelines in treating UTI's and other infections and not overuse antibiotics to prevent the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria.","[('Urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('mannitol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus mirabilis', 'DISEASE'), ('Acinetobacter baumannii', 'DISEASE'), ('K. pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('K. pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"
40161061,2025,"Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining malignancy caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), predominantly affecting immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with untreated or advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Here, we present the case of a 28-year-old homeless transgender female with untreated HIV (CD4 count = 175 cells/muL, HIV RNA = 221,000 copies/mL), latent syphilis, and methamphetamine use disorder, who presented with a five-month history of progressive left foot pain, ulceration, and swelling. Initial examination revealed extensive bilateral lower extremity ulcerative lesions, with a necrotic, violaceous mass on the left hallux and a similar lesion on the right medial ankle, raising suspicion for KS. However, the presence of purulent drainage and surrounding erythema suggested a superimposed bacterial infection. Bedside incision and drainage of the left hallux lesion was performed, followed by formal surgical debridement and excision of infected soft tissue masses. Histopathologic examination confirmed KS, characterized by spindle cell proliferation, slit-like vascular channels, and HHV-8 positivity on immunohistochemical staining. Wound cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), indicating a concurrent bacterial infection. The patient was initiated on antiretroviral therapy with Biktarvy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) and treated with linezolid and amoxicillin-clavulanate for MRSA. Wound care and offloading led to significant improvement, with reduced drainage and progressive healing. This case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of KS masquerading as MRSA soft tissue infection in immunocompromised patients. The overlapping clinical features of KS and bacterial infections, particularly in the lower extremities, highlight the importance of early biopsy, histopathologic confirmation, and a multidisciplinary approach to care. Furthermore, this case emphasizes the impact of social determinants of health, such as homelessness and substance use, on disease progression and treatment outcomes. Addressing these barriers is essential for improving care in vulnerable populations with complex, multifactorial conditions.","[('Kaposi sarcoma', 'DISEASE'), ('acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining malignancy', 'DISEASE'), ('human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), predominantly affecting immunocompromised', 'DISEASE'), ('human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).', 'DISEASE'), ('syphilis', 'DISEASE'), ('methamphetamine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('disorder', 'DISEASE'), ('left foot pain', 'DISEASE'), ('ulceration', 'DISEASE'), ('lower extremity ulcerative lesions', 'DISEASE'), ('necrotic', 'DISEASE'), ('hallux', 'DISEASE'), ('purulent', 'DISEASE'), ('erythema', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial infection', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial infection', 'DISEASE'), ('bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide', 'DISEASE'), ('linezolid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"
40160730,2025,"Chalcones are organic chromophores with diverse biological applications and potential for use in various electronic devices due to their recognized optical properties. This research focuses on the organic synthesis, FT-NMR characterization, and biotransformation of three azachalcones (1-3) using the Exserohilum rostratum fungus, yielding novel compounds (1a-3a). In vitro biological assays against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria revealed promising pharmacological potential for these new chromophores. A key structural difference, the interchange of an HC = CH bond by a H(2)C-CH(2) bond, significantly impacts biological and electronic properties. For instance, while biotransformed 1a exhibits similar activity to tetracycline and amoxicillin, compounds 2a and 3a demonstrate a 4-fold and thirty-fold increase in inhibitory activity against Gram-negative E. coli, respectively, compared to their parent compounds. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the biotransformation reaction reduces the refractive index (n), which may limit its applicability in certain light-handling applications. However, Hyper-Rayleigh scattering calculations indicate that these chromophores exhibit higher nonlinear optical (NLO) responses compared to standard NLO materials such as urea and p-nitroaniline, making them promising candidates for photonic and optoelectronic devices, such as nanostructured circuits. Interestingly, while the original molecules exhibit a dominant dipolar (Phi (J=1)) NLO response, the biotransformed compounds, as stable isomers, display a predominant octupolar (Phi (J=3)) architecture. These findings highlight the potential of these novel compounds for biotechnological and optoelectronic applications.","[('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('urea', 'CHEMICAL'), ('p-nitroaniline', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Prudent antibiotic use is essential for enhancing health outcomes and reducing AMR. This study assesses antibiotic prescribing practices and their logic in a public community health facility catering to 12,900 urban and rural populations in North India. METHODS: Cross-sectional research was performed from August 2021 to August 2022, examining 1219 outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. The data encompassed medication kind, dose, duration, adherence to therapeutic criteria, and rationale evaluated by ID specialists and clinical pharmacologists. The evaluation was conducted in accordance with standard procedures, including those from NCDC and PGIMER. Demographics, antibiotic classifications, WHO AWaRe categories, diagnoses, and compliance with the essential drug list (EDL) were evaluated. RESULTS: The results indicated that 45.9 % of prescriptions were for males and 54 % for females, predominantly involving individuals aged 20-40 years. Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (27.2 %) was the most often given antibiotic, followed by metronidazole (13.4 %) and azithromycin (10.3 %). The WHO AWaRe categorization revealed that 49.7 % of antibiotics were categorized as ""Access,"" 27.3 % as ""Watch,"" and none as ""Reserve."" An examination of rationality indicated that 57 % of urinary tract infection prescriptions were justified, but just 29 % of respiratory tract infection prescriptions were deemed logical. Diarrhea and respiratory tract infections were recognized as primary targets for minimizing superfluous antibiotic consumption.

Given the severity and potentially high fatality rate of TEN, identifying high-risk drugs is essential for improving clinical medication safety. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to assess drug-related TEN reports in the FAERS database between Q1 2004 and Q3 2024. Univariate analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariate logistic regression were employed to explore the risk factors associated with drug-induced TEN. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. A total of 218 drugs were identified as being associated with TEN, including anticonvulsants (26/218), antibiotics (54/218), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (12/218), antineoplastic agents (3/218), and immunomodulatory drugs (8/218). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the age group 37-66 years, as well as 26 specific drugs, including lamotrigine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, and amoxicillin, might be risk factors factors for drug-induced TEN. These findings provide valuable insights to assist clinicians in early identification of drug-induced TEN, and offer a theoretical foundation for future drug safety evaluations and personalized treatment strategies.Constrained by the inherent limitations of disproportionality analysis, the current research findings on drugs related to TEN have a certain degree of uncertainty.

In 2019, the Government of Pakistan revised the national Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) chart booklet, following the World Health Organization's recommendation for outpatient management with oral antibiotics of children aged 2-59 months with chest indrawing pneumonia. We aimed to assess the outcomes of children aged 2-59 months with chest indrawing pneumonia in programme setting of Pakistan. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study in three primary health care facilities in Thatta district, Sindh province. We screened children aged 2-59 months who presented with cough and/or difficult breathing, and recruited those classified with chest indrawing pneumonia according to the IMCI tool. from December 2022 to March 2024. The primary outcome was to assess the case fatality ratio. The secondary outcomes were to calculate the prevalence of antibiotic use, hospital admissions and treatment adherence among these children during the current illness. We followed up on day 15 after enrolment to assess outcomes. RESULTS: 456 children with chest indrawing pneumonia met the study's enrolment criteria. Two (0.4%) died. Four (0.9%) were lost to follow-up and excluded from the analysis. According to parental/caregiver reports, among 452 children followed up on day 15, 435 (96.3%) were cured, 12 (2.7%) did not improve and two (0.4%) worsened and were hospitalised. All patients were treated with oral antibiotics. Oral amoxicillin was prescribed and used by 282 (62.4%) and 236 of those (83.7%) adhered to five or more days of oral amoxicillin treatment. Oral cefixime was prescribed and used by 114 children (25.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support using the IMCI protocol for treating chest indrawing pneumonia without danger signs in children aged 2-59 months with oral antibiotics on an outpatient basis.

The characterization tests including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) were evaluated to distinguish the physical and chemical properties of the nanocomposites. The adsorption capacity and catalytic performance of the prepared samples for the removal of AMX were investigated in order to compare the presented catalysts, in addition to the structural analysis. Among the fabricated samples, the magnetic nano-catalyst derived from two different sources of iron (ferrous sulfate and ferric nitrate) named FSF-Be was selected as the appropriate catalyst due to its high efficiency for the simultaneous degradation of CLX and AMX. Response surface method (RSM-central composite design (CCD)) was also applied to determine the effect of the operating conditions encompassing pH, initial concentration of contaminants, dosage of catalyst and hydrogen peroxide concentration for the degradation of CLX and AMX, simultaneously. The quadratic mathematical models were developed with high correlation coefficient (0.9454 and 0.9564) for the removal efficiency of AMX and CLX, respectively. Therefore, the maximum degradation efficiency of CLX and AMX was obtained to be about 96.36% and 81.61%, respectively, at the optimal conditions (pH of 3, H(2)O(2) concentration of 12 mM, catalyst dosage of 0.24 g/L and initial concentration of 23 mg/L) in half hour. The ozonation and the combined photo-Fenton/ozone process were investigated. The mineralization analysis illustrated that the photo-Fenton process was able to remove TOC by 73.35%, while only 2.44% of TOC removal was reached by ozonation. The degradation efficiency of CLX and AMX in the photo-Fenton/ozone system within 15 min of reaction was measured as 87.69% and 70.02%, respectively, and 61.9% mineralization was achieved in this system. However, the results showed that the photo-Fenton using FSF-Be was more efficient. The regeneration and reusability of the prepared nanocomposite was also carried out by five consecutive cycles which showed an acceptable performance in the industrial applications.

SETTING: Linkage of four nationwide registries: Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN), Norwegian Prescribed Drug Registry (NorPD), Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) and Norwegian Control and Payment of Health Reimbursements Database (KUHR). POPULATION OR SAMPLE: A total of 704 082 pregnancies (2009-2018), with 91 836 (13.0%) exposed to systemic antimicrobials in early pregnancy. METHODS: Time-stratified Cox regression models with overlap weights were used, considering time-varying exposures and a 14-day lag to prevent reverse causation. Elective terminations were right-censored to address competing risks, with adjustment for common infections and probabilistic bias analysis for confounding by indication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Miscarriage and gestational age at miscarriage, captured from NPR, KUHR and MBRN, using the UiO pregnancy algorithm. RESULTS: Nitrofurantoin, pivmecillinam and amoxicillin were not associated with increased miscarriage risk. Metronidazole (HR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.82-2.21), ciprofloxacin (HR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.62-2.20), cephalexin (HR = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.57-2.22), fluconazole (HR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.45-1.78), trimethoprim-sulfas (HR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.36-1.63) and others showed associations with miscarriage. Probabilistic bias analysis indicated that associations for common antimicrobials may be driven by the underlying infections.

We aimed to assess the impact of amoxicillin shortage on antimicrobial prescription patterns and quality indexes in the same setting as the past AMS campaign. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of antibiotic prescriptions in a primary care pediatric practice, focusing on amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, third-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, and quinolones. To assess drug accessibility, we monitored antibiotic availability in pharmacies within the same healthcare district. We then analyzed monthly prescription rates per 100 consultations in relation to drug availability patterns and calculated the amoxicillin/amoxicillin-clavulanate index and the Access/Watch index as quality indicators. Results: From November 2022 to May 2023, 90% of the surveyed pharmacies reported an amoxicillin shortage lasting 5 to 7 months.

Escherichia coli, a widely distributed facultative anaerobic pathogen, is significant both in terms of the clinical diseases that it causes and as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance, with notable implications for both animal and public health. Within the poultry industry, the turkey sector is an emerging and internationally significant branch. Methods: Our objective was to assess the antimicrobial resistance profile of commensal Escherichia coli strains isolated from large-scale turkey flocks in Hungary using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Results: A total of 470 isolates were analyzed, revealing that 61.5% of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin, while 18.5% were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The resistance observed against enrofloxacin (62.8%) and ceftriaxone (24%) is concerning. Comparison with human resistance data showed a similar resistance rate for amoxicillin and ampicillin, as well as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cephalosporins. However, for other active substances, the situation was significantly worse in veterinary medicine. Conclusions: The lower resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid indicates that most strains are beta-lactamase producers.

Methods: Nineteen samples were collected from healthy and diseased dogs and cats. Isolates were studied for their antibiotic-resistance patterns (disc diffusion method) and biofilm formation (Microtiter assay) and were whole-genome sequenced (MinION). Results: Nineteen P. aeruginosa strains (15 from dogs and 4 from cats) were isolated. Antibiotic-resistance phenotypes were observed against amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (100%); meanwhile, resistance towards ticarcillin was 40% (dogs) and 25% (cats), ticarcillin-clavulanic acid was 13.33% and 25% for dogs and cats, respectively, and imipenem was 75% (cats) and 20% (dogs).

However, the ethanolic extracts of O. tenuiflorum were found effective in inhibiting the growth of eight species at three different concentrations. Subsequent HPLC analysis of O. tenuiflorum reported the presence of five secondary metabolites epicatechin, syringic acid, rutin hydrate, p-coumaric acid, and myricetin as potent contributors to the observed antimicrobial activity. Lastly, in silico binding interaction simulations of the secondary metabolites against five relevant targets predict syringic acid and myricetin to have effective antibacterial properties, primarily mediated by better binding affinity and molecular interactions. Thus, this study identified diverse drug-resistant bacteria in raw beef and provided novel insights into the antibacterial properties of O. tenuiflorum extracts.","[('pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('flucloxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('epicatechin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('syringic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rutin hydrate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('p-coumaric acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('syringic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('myricetin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40147700,2025,"The recurrence rate of spontaneous pneumothorax (collapsed lung) is 30 % after basic conservative treatments, and it can reach up to 20 % after surgery due to the limited effectiveness of current surgical techniques. This highlights the need for the development of new, effective treatment approaches supported by biomaterials. Therefore, we aimed to develop a biomaterial that does not restrict the aerodynamic movements of the lungs, is resistant to lung pressure, and can withstand the movements during inhalation and exhalation,to prevent and treat pneumothorax recurrence. For this purpose, biodegradable matrices were prepared using polycaprolactone (PCL), gelatin (GEL), and amoxicillin (AMX), which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The matrices were designed with a nanofiber/net (NFN) structure, targeting appropriate degradation rates and mechanical strength. NFN matrices with randomly arranged and bead-free fibers were produced by electrospinning PCL/GEL and PCL/GEL-AMX solutions in different ratios. The incorporation of AMX reduced the fiber diameter, while the addition of GEL increased the fiber diameters, resulting in fibrous matrices with diameters ranging from 194 nm to 1,100 nm. Additionally, adding GEL and/or AMX to the structure caused the fiber surfaces to resemble tree bark, and spider web-like nano networks formed between the fibers. These formations were particularly homogeneous and dense in the (7:3) PCL/GEL-5AMX group. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the elemental composition of the fibers and the nano-networks was similar. The elastic moduli of the matrix groups ranged from 3.97 +/- 0.74 MPa to 19.02 +/- 1.91 MPa, which was found to be suitable for the target range for lung tissue. Hydrolytic degradation studies indicated that nano-networks remained present in the structure after 5 weeks, and 55-68 % of the loaded AMX was released within 14 days. In the AMX-loaded groups, both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Streptococcus aureus (S. aureus) growth were inhibited, with the most effective inhibition observed in the (7:3) PCL/GEL-5AMX group. In conclusion, it was assessed that the spider web-like nano-networks, which increased with the GEL and AMX ratio in the solution, mimicked the structure of lung alveoli at the nanoscale due to their large surface area and small pore size between the fibers. Particularly, the (7:3) PCL/GEL-5AMX NFN matrix could be used as a new and effective alternative material in pneumothorax therapy.","[('pneumothorax', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumothorax', 'DISEASE'), ('polycaprolactone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NFN', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NFN', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NFN', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumothorax', 'DISEASE')]"
40146670,2025,"In this study, a novel three-dimensional (3D) electrode system (3D-Co(3)O(4)/GAC-PMS) was constructed that can effectively degrade amoxicillin (AMX) in aqueous solution using granular activated carbon (GAC) loaded with Co(3)O(4) catalyst (Co(3)O(4)/GAC) as a catalyst for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as well as particle electrode. The effects of the main operating parameters on AMX degradation, TOC removal, electrical energy consumption and current efficiency were investigated. Under the optimum operating conditions (initial solution pH of 5.9, PMS concentration of 13 mmol/L, current density of 5.6 mA/cm(2)), 99.9% of AMX was degraded after 10 min of treatment and 96.8% of TOC was removed after 120 min of treatment. Meanwhile, the electrical energy consumption of the system was very small, only 45.1 kWh/kg TOC. Comparative experiments with other systems and kinetic analysis have confirmed the superior performance of the 3D-Co(3)O(4)/GAC-PMS system for the degradation of AMX. During five cycles, the Co(3)O(4)/GAC particle electrode showed excellent stability and long lifetime. The 3D-Co(3)O(4)/GAC-PMS system simultaneously degraded 100% of three different pharmaceuticals (amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and acetaminophen) after 8 min of reaction and removed 88.1% TOC after 120 min of reaction, which suggested the applicability of the system for real wastewater treatment. The degradation of AMX was confirmed using UV-Vis spectroscopy and the reaction mechanism of the 3D-Co(3)O(4)/GAC-PMS system was proposed. Based on the intermediates detected by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatograph coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass-spectrometry, the degradation pathways of AMX in the 3D-Co(3)O(4)/GAC-PMS system were presented.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbon', 'CHEMICAL'), ('peroxymonosulfate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('PMS', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('PMS', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('acetaminophen', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('3D-Co(3)O(4)/GAC-PMS', 'CHEMICAL')]"

This retrospective study evaluated TFNA results and bacterial culture findings in 14 dogs (1 dog twice) and two cats with bacterial pneumonia. Bacterial culture yielded positive results in 9/16 (56.3%) of samples. Only 1/11 (9.1%) of isolated bacterial species showed resistance to empiric treatment (amoxicillin with clavulanate). Six patients without prior antimicrobial treatment had negative bacterial cultures, despite the presence of intracellular bacteria on cytology samples. For patients with suspected bacterial pneumonia, we should consider performing both cytological examination and bacterial culture of lung aspirates, with careful interpretation of the results. Bacterial culture should be considered regardless of ongoing or previous antibiotic treatment, and even in cases where intracellular bacteria are not identified on cytology. Based on our antimicrobial susceptibility findings, first-line empirical treatment with amoxicillin with clavulanate might be an appropriate choice in most of cases regardless of the previous treatment.","[('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacterial pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL')]"

We recorded a pattern in the plasma EBV-DNA load consisting of a significant increase at the onset of the rash with a sudden remission after its resolution. The patient recovered without sequelae. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: The temporal relationship and the reported data on rash morphology, clinical findings and triggering factors support a possible correlation between the intake of beta-lactam antibiotics, particularly amoxicillin, and the onset of cutaneous manifestations in a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Such reactions can be a challenging differential diagnosis and may warrant increased provider consideration when choosing to prescribe beta lactams in patients affected by nasopharyngeal cancer.","[('acute EBV infection', 'DISEASE'), ('exanthema', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('EBV-related nasopharyngeal carcinoma', 'DISEASE'), ('EBV-DNA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rash', 'DISEASE'), ('rash', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nasopharyngeal carcinoma', 'DISEASE'), ('nasopharyngeal cancer', 'DISEASE')]"

This study aimed to describe the distribution of uropathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility, focusing on oral formulations. METHODS: Data from the first microbiological isolation, between January 2007 and December 2023, at Istituto Gaslini, in young infants (aged <6 months), were analyzed. RESULTS: We isolated 2473 infants' first pathogen, with a median age in the sample of 2.8 months and 62.6% male. A total of 2498 bacterial isolates were identified, of which 88.8% were Gram-negative and 11.2% were Gram-positive. Escherichia coli (53%) was the most frequent isolate, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%) and Enterococcus spp. (9.6%). No significant differences were observed between males and females, but infants younger than 3 months exhibited a significantly different pathogen distribution compared to older infants. The pathogen distribution showed significant changes before and after 2015, with a marked increase in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates post-2015. Escherichia coli showed increases in resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin after 2015.

Conducting molecular epidemiological studies of APEC plays a crucial role in its prevention and control. This study aims to elucidate the molecular epidemiological characteristics of Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli in Shanxi Province. In this study, 135 APEC strains were isolated and identified from 150 liver samples of diseased and deceased chickens exhibiting clinical symptoms, which were collected from farms in Shanxi Province between 2021 and 2023. The isolates were then analyzed for phylogenetic clustering, drug resistance, resistance genes, virulence genes, and biofilm formation capabilities. The results revealed that the proportions of the A, B1, B2, and D evolutionary subgroups were 26.67%, 32.59%, 17.78%, and 15.56%, respectively. The drug resistance testing results indicated that 92% of the isolates exhibited resistance to cotrimoxazole, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, amoxicillin, tetracycline, and other antibiotics. In contrast, 95% of the strains were sensitive to ofloxacin, amikacin, and ceftazidime. The most prevalent resistance genes included tetracycline-related (tetA) at 88.15%, followed by beta-lactam-related (bla-TEM) at 85.19%, and peptide-related (mcr1) at 12.59%.

40142292,2025,"Background and Objective: Irrational use and overuse of antibiotics is considered a major cause of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among patients admitted to hospitals, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). ICUs are the most critical wards in healthcare settings, where the use of antibiotics is much higher compared to other wards. Therefore, the appropriate administration and monitoring of antibiotic usage in these units is a matter of concern. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study evaluated the types, utilization patterns, sensitivity, and resistance of various antibiotics used among patients admitted to the ICUs of different hospitals after the third wave of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) in Pakistan. Results: It was observed that more than 40% of the patients were given two antibiotics and 54.3% were given at least one antibiotic each day. A total of 768 antibiotics from different groups, based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification, were prescribed to 313 patients admitted to ICUs between April and August 2021. Among the types of antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was the most frequently used antibiotic (75 prescriptions). It was also observed that the majority of the bacterial isolates were more sensitive to carbapenems than the other antibiotics. The current study showed that antibiotic usage according to the AWaRe classifications was 31.8% in the Access category, 59.5% in the Watch category, and 8.7% in the Reserve category in ICUs of the studied hospitals after the third wave of COVID-19. Conclusions: The findings of the study also highlight the importance and continuous need for the implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs to optimize the appropriate utilization of antibiotics in the ICUs of the studied hospitals.","[('coronavirus disease', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40140854,2025,"Sinusitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the paranasal sinuses. Bacterial sinusitis usually occurs as a complication of viral infections of the upper respiratory tract and is a frequent cause of medical consultation. The clinical presentation of acute bacterial sinusitis can vary. It most commonly manifests as an upper respiratory tract infection (nasal congestion, postnasal drip, cough) that persists for more than 10 days without clinical improvement. Unfortunately, updated guidelines in paediatric age are not currently available. The purpose of this consensus is to provide guidelines for the therapeutic management of previous healthy paediatric patients with sinusitis. A systematic review was conducted to identify the most recent and relevant evidence. Embase, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane databases were systematically screened, combining the terms ""children"" and ""sinusitis"" and ""antibiotics"" and ""rhinosinusitis"" with a date restriction from 2012 to April 2024, but without language limitations. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methods. The final recommendations were obtained through a Delphi consensus of an expert panel. In children with a diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis, made according to strict clinical criteria, systemic empiric antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is indicated at a high dose (90 mg/kg/day, calculated based on amoxicillin, preferably in 3 daily doses) and for at least 10 days. In children with chronic sinusitis, systemic antibiotic treatment is not recommended, and it is not possible to make any specific recommendation regarding antibiotic agents due to the scarcity of scientific evidence supporting treatment. In conclusion, the diagnosis of sinusitis is primarily clinical, and despite acute sinusitis generally having a favourable course, some cases can present orbital and intracranial complications. The misuse of antibiotics in managing upper respiratory tract infections, including acute sinusitis, and the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance are a current issue in paediatric care.

40135203,2025,"OBJECTIVES: Knowledge of local antibiotic susceptibility rates is essential to strengthen antimicrobial stewardship programs. DASH to Protect Antibiotics (https://dashuti.com/), promotes the dissemination of focused local antibiograms in community urinary tract infection (UTI). This study mapped the susceptibility profile of Klebsiella pneumoniae from 18 Indian centers. METHODS: The centers spanned nine Indian States and three Union Territories. Urinary K. pneumoniae antibiograms from the outpatient clinic were collated and analyzed. Standardization was achieved through online training. For epidemiological purposes, five centers tested fosfomycin. RESULTS: Overall, low susceptibility (<60%) was observed for the standard oral antibiotics prescribed for cystitis: co-trimoxazole, 54% (36-68%); ciprofloxacin, 52% (29-55%); amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 46%, (35-82%); nitrofurantoin, 39% (19-78%); and cefuroxime, 30% (15-62%). The rates for third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins were 49% (45-52%) and 60% (36-76%), respectively. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases ranged from 36-61% in India. Piperacillin-tazobactam 74% (65-87%), amikacin 76% (45-91%), and meropenem 81% (61-87%) exhibited higher activity. Fosfomycin was the most active antimicrobial, with 89% (92-97%) susceptibility. K. pneumoniae susceptibility was directly linked to geographic region, log gross domestic product (P <0.001), and humidity, and low and high temperatures (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Oral treatment options for K. pneumoniae cystitis are rapidly decreasing. Northern and southern India showed significant differences in antimicrobial susceptibility, highlighting the importance of local antibiograms for promoting antimicrobial stewardship. For uncomplicated cystitis, co-trimoxazole (54%) may be the empirical choice. Good susceptibility to fosfomycin was observed (89%).

The present in vitro study was done to assess the antimicrobial activity of PRF and titanium PRF (T-PRF) alone or with antibiotics on periodontal pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three individuals who were willing to donate blood (12 ml) were included in the study. Amoxicillin (AMOX) + metronidazole (METRO) combination or clindamycin (CLINDA) was incorporated into the blood drawn, and this blood was subjected to centrifugation so as to obtain T-PRF and PRF with antibiotics. The antibacterial activity of all the groups was tested on both bacteria that were cultured in their respective media for up to a 4-day period. The data were subjected to independent t-test, Tukey post hoc test, repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA), and ANOVA. RESULTS: All individual parameters were compared for antimicrobial activity on both bacteria on all 4 days. A highly statistical difference (P = 0.0001) was observed in all the groups, with the highest inhibition zone produced by PRF-CLINDA, followed by T-PRF-CLINDA.

40134000,2025,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates the postoperative benefits of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in enhancing patient comfort and reducing complications after mandibular third molar extractions. METHODS: Sixty patients with vertically impacted mandibular third molars were randomly assigned to one control and three test groups (n = 15 each). In Group 1, PRF was applied to the socket post-extraction. In Group 2, PRF was combined with LLLT (B-Cure Dental Laser, 808 nm wavelength, 4 J/cm(2) energy density, continuous wave) applied extra-orally for three days post-surgery. Group 3 received LLLT alone. Group 4 (control group) underwent traditional osteotomy without additional treatments. All patients were prescribed 875/125 mg amoxicillin/clavulanic acid twice daily for five days. RESULTS: Postoperative parameters such as pain, swelling, analgesic use, and trismus were assessed on days 1, 2, 3, and 7. Significant improvements in pain, swelling, and trismus were observed in Groups 2 and 3 compared to the control (p < 0.001). Swelling was also significantly reduced in Group 1 compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes in the LLLT and PRF groups, suggesting that both treatments could be promising strategies for improving postoperative recovery in terms of comfort and reduced complications.

She had two prior hospitalisations for presumed viral meningitis. Examination was unremarkable except for neck extension pain. Labs showed neutrophil predominance (92.8%) with cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis and elevated protein. CT revealed a 3 mm right tonsillar abscess. Initially improving with symptomatic care, she later developed vomiting, headache and fever after receiving Augmentin for the abscess, inadvertently confirming an amoxicillin allergy. She was discharged after 72 hours but re-presented with persistent symptoms and was ultimately discharged on hospital day 5. At follow-up, she reported residual weakness and fatigue.

40130800,2025,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study investigated the association between the use of antibiotics and the occurrence of DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) syndrome, a rare and serious adverse event characterized by eosinophilia and acute skin rash. Without early diagnosis, the syndrome can lead to complications or even death. METHODS: In 2020, the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) made available a system for reporting adverse drug events, called VigiMed. Reports of adverse events registered on this system between December 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022, were analyzed. Reporting odds ratio (ROR), together with the respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), was calculated as a measure of the association between antibiotics and DRESS syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 160,101 reports of adverse drug events were analyzed, with 136 suspected cases of DRESS syndrome. Compared with other drugs, the following frequencies of suspected DRESS syndrome were observed for the use of any antibiotic (ROR: 4.8; 95% CI: 3.3-7.0), meropenem (ROR: 13.0; 95% CI: 8.0-21.0), vancomycin (ROR: 11.5; 95% CI: 7.4-17.6), ampicillin (ROR: 6.8; 95% CI: 2.1-21.8), amoxicillin (ROR: 4.7; 95% CI: 1.5-15.0), cefepime (ROR: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.3-13.6), piperacillin + tazobactam (ROR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.1-5.8) and ceftriaxone (ROR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.1-5.1). The ROR for DRESS syndrome and the use of oxacillin was 2.7 with a wide 95% CI (0.7-11.1). CONCLUSIONS: An association was observed between reports of DRESS syndrome and the use of antibiotics, particularly those routinely used in a hospital setting. Although there is a potential risk of underreporting or unattributed causality, the information obtained in this study is valuable for the analysis of rare adverse reactions. Given the seriousness of the findings, further studies should be conducted to obtain more accurate information about this adverse reaction.","[('DRESS', 'DISEASE'), ('Eosinophilia', 'DISEASE'), ('eosinophilia', 'DISEASE'), ('rash', 'DISEASE'), ('death', 'DISEASE'), ('DRESS syndrome', 'DISEASE'), ('DRESS syndrome', 'DISEASE'), ('DRESS syndrome', 'DISEASE'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefepime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('piperacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tazobactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DRESS syndrome', 'DISEASE'), ('oxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DRESS syndrome', 'DISEASE')]"

40129122,2025,"AIMS: Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is a widely used antibiotic for treating bacterial infections, but its safety in adult outpatients remains understudied. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the safety profile of SMX-TMP and identified critical research gaps. The pharmacovigilance study aimed to validate and extend findings from meta-analyses to better understand the real-world safety of SMX-TMP. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Embase up to 12 August 2024, to identify studies comparing adverse drug events (ADEs) following SMX-TMP vs. other antibiotics in adult outpatients. Meta-analyses were performed where data allowed. A pharmacovigilance study using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System was conducted to supplement our findings. RESULTS: Our review, which included 43 studies, found SMX-TMP had a nearly 3-fold higher risk of rash compared to other antibiotics (pooled risk ratio 2.56, 95% confidence interval [1.69, 3.89], I(2) = 0%, n = 4458 participants, 24 randomized control trials). Pharmacovigilance data confirmed a higher frequencies of skin disorders and other ADEs compared to various comparator drugs. Compared to azithromycin, SMX-TMP was associated with a 5-fold increase in Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a 3-fold increase in toxic epidermal necrolysis, and a 10-fold increase in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Additionally, SMX-TMP showed a 10-fold increase in reports of pancytopenia, a 6-fold increase in neutropenia, a 4-fold increase in both thrombocytopenia and aplastic anaemia, a 56-fold increase in hyperkalaemia, and a 10-fold increase in hyponatraemia. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analyses and pharmacovigilance study suggested SMX-TMP was associated with increased risk of ADEs compared to other antibiotics including amoxicillin/clavulanate, azithromycin and nitrofurantoin.

Post-pandemic, there has been a notable rise in ENT infections globally, particularly ear infections. In our region, we observed an increase in complicated pediatric ENT infections requiring urgent surgical intervention after the end of preventive measures. This study investigates the changes in ENT infection profiles in Madrid, Spain, following the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed data from children who underwent urgent ENT surgical interventions at a Spanish tertiary hospital between January 2018 and December 2023. The data was divided into three groups: pre-pandemic (1st group), during the pandemic with preventive measures (2nd group), and post-pandemic after the removal of these measures (3rd group). Variables included demographics, clinical data, imaging, treatment, and hospitalization duration. RESULTS: The study involved 87 children (58.6% male) with a mean age of 6.4 years. There was a significant overall increase in ENT infections in the 3rd group compared to the 1st and 2nd groups (p = 0.036). Specifically, ear infections increased significantly after the removal of social measures (p = 0.033). In the 3rd group, Streptococcus pyogenes infections increased (p = 0.028), with Amoxicillin becoming the predominant treatment (p = 0.047), as opposed to Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid used for Fusobacterium in earlier periods (p = 0.00).

The production of metallo beta-lactamase (MBL) puts the health sector at great risk as it further limits the treatment option for MDR strain. The current study aims to determine the prevalence, antibacterial sensitivity pattern, and molecular characterization of MBL in Uropathogenic E. coli from clinical samples of hospitalized patients in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. METHODS: From tertiary care hospitals in Peshawar, 250 Urine samples were collected from indoor hospitalized patients. Gold standard microbiological methods were used to identify UPEC from these clinical samples.For that,urine samples was inoculated onto Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte. Deficient (CLED) agar plate, and MacConkey Agar.Positive growth of E. coli identified through Gram staining, colony morphology, Biochemical Tests and E.coli 16srRNA gene amplification .Antibiotic sensitivity was determined by the disc diffusion method on Muller Hinton agar. For the detection of MBL production double disc synergy, and a combination disc test of the antibiotics were used. Furthermore, multiplex PCR was used for the molecular characterization of the MBL (blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaNDM) genes. RESULTS: Of the 250 samples, only 110 samples were confirmed as Uropathogenic E. coli based on colonial morphology, biochemical testing, and molecular level by targeting the 16SrDNA. Female was found more susceptible to UTI compared to male. High prevalence was found in the age group 45-65 years. UPEC was found highly resistance to Ciprofloxacin (90%), followed by Cefotaxime and Ceftriaxone (86%), Ceftazidime and Augmentin (81%), Tazobactam (61%). while the lowest resistance was reported against Meropenum (20%) Imipenem (18%) and Amikacin (37%). PCR-based confirmed prevalence of MBL encoding genes was blaNDM (42%), blaVIM (32%), and blaIMP (26%). CONCLUSIONS: The study proposed a higher prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in females aged group 54-65 years compared to males. An analysis of antibiotic sensitivity revealed Imipenem and Meropenem to be the most effective antimicrobial agents, while Ciprofloxacin, Cefotaxime and Amoxicillin were found to be the less effective.

40121403,2025,"The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global menace to both public and animal health sectors with devastating effects in developing countries. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human health and livestock management contributes to development and rapid spread of AMR. Staphylococcus aureus is a major opportunistic zoonotic pathogen that colonises the skin and nostrils of human beings and animals and continues to develop antimicrobial resistance against different agents. The study aimed to determine multiple antibiotic resistance indices of S. aureus isolates from healthy domestic goats and slaughterhouse attendants in Kampala, Uganda.Demographic characteristics of consenting slaughterhouse attendants and goat keepers were recorded through a questionnaire. Antibiotics use among slaughterhouse workers and domestic goats and skin infections in the past twelve months were recorded. Nasal swabs were collected from healthy domestic goats at household level (n = 378) and slaughterhouse attendants (n = 131). Isolates were obtained on mannitol salt agar (MSA) upon incubation at 35 degrees C for 24 h. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility to penicillin, gentamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, linezolid, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone and cefoxitin. In this study, the participating slaughterhouse workers were predominantly male (79%) while does (90%) were the majority of the goats sampled. S. aureus carriage was 32% and 43% among slaughterhouse workers and goats, respectively. Methicillin resistant S. aureus carriage was 12% and 11% among slaughterhouse attendants and goats, respectively. There was a high level of exposure to antibiotics among S. aureus carriers (62%) and goats (41%) in the past one year, including use of critically important antimicrobials in human medicine for livestock disease management. Amoxicillin (17%) and ciprofloxacin (12%) were the most used antibiotics among the S. aureus carriers. Oxytetracycline (33%) and Penicillin-streptomycin combination (21%) were the most used antimicrobials in goat keeping. Close to a quarter of the human participants reported having suffered probable staphylococcal related infections like pustules in the previous months. With the exception of gentamycin and linezolid, all the S. aureus isolates from human nasal swabs were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics used. S. aureus isolates from goats' nasal swabs were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics studied. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of 41% of S. aureus isolates from slaughterhouse attendants was greater than 0.2 (mean = 0.2 +/- 0.2, range 0.1 to 0.7). The MAR index of 22% of S. aureus isolates from goats was greater than 0.2 (mean = 0.2 +/- 0.1, range = 0 to 0.7).

40120715,2025,"Antimicrobials are sometimes inappropriately administered in dog breeding facilities in an attempt to improve fertility or reduce neonatal losses, but these practices lead to an increased prevalence of resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to assess antibiotic use intensity in breeding kennels by comparing the resistance profiles of Escherichia coli and coagulase positive Staphylococci isolated from breeding bitches and from household animals. A rectal and a perivulvar swab were collected from 80 healthy bitches, half of which were housed in breeding kennels and the other half in domestic environments. The resistance of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and S.aureus to a range of antimicrobials was evaluated through the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration test. Antibiotic resistance rates, the percentage of Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing E.coli strains, the percentage of mecA positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and of Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) isolates were compared between breeding bitches and privately owned ones using Fisher's exact test. The percentage of resistance to the antimicrobials tested was generally higher in dogs from breeding kennels than in owned animals, with statistically significant differences in E.coli for cefazolin (p < 0.0001), third-generation cephalosporins (p = 0.0015), tetracycline (p = 0.0079), kanamycin (p = 0.0291) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (p = 0.0007). Furthermore, the prevalence of ESBL E.coli was significantly higher in breeding dogs (p = 0.0002). 38.5 % of breeding bitches and 12.5 % of household dogs carried methicillin-resistant mecA positive S.pseudintermedius strains. S.aureus was only isolated from household animals, and one of the three isolates was mecA positive and MDR. Our data indicate a higher exposure of kennel dogs to antimicrobials. The pattern of antibiotic resistance, particularly to aminopenicillins but also to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, suggests a large use of these agents. The results confirm that healthy dogs can harbour commensal bacteria that have acquired antimicrobial resistances, which may be exchanged between hosts; the potential role of the two dog typologies as reservoirs for resistance genes was demonstrated. The risk of household dogs being exposed to resistant bacteria, probably of human origin, was also observed. Our study reveals a generally high exposure of dogs to antimicrobials and highlights the need to sensitise veterinarians and breeders to better antibiotic stewardship.","[('S.aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('E.coli', 'DISEASE'), ('E.coli', 'DISEASE'), ('cefazolin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('kanamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ESBL E.coli', 'DISEASE'), ('S.aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('aminopenicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL')]"

He developed inflammatory pain in the left buttock, fever and tachycardia 11 days after the last session. Examination revealed involvement of the left sacroiliac joint. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was consistent with sacroiliitis and blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The final diagnosis was left sacroiliitis caused by S. aureus. He was treated with lincomycin.Case 2:A 55-year-old female who had undergone 10 acupuncture sessions presented with inflammatory gluteal pain 10 days after the last session. Physical examination revealed signs of sacroiliac involvement, confirmed by MRI of the pelvis. The diagnosis was right sacroiliitis complicated by myositis of the gluteal muscles caused by S. aureus. Treatment consisted of antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin and ofloxacin.Case 3:A 72-year-old female who had undergone 10 acupuncture sessions presented 5 days after the last session for inflammatory gluteal pain. On examination, left unipodal weight-bearing was impossible and the tripod sign was present. MRI and clinical findings were in favor of left sacroiliitis associated with infectious pyogenic spondylodiscitis at L4-L5 and paravertebral abscesses.

40119275,2025,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and septic shock are significant global healthcare challenges with high mortality rates. Effective management requires timely and adequate antimicrobial therapy. Beta-lactam antibiotics, commonly used in patients with sepsis, are crucial for treating these infections. However, standard dosing often leads to insufficient plasma levels due to dynamic physiological changes in critically ill patients. Previous randomized controlled trials highlighted the need for timely dose adjustments to improve clinical outcomes. This is the study protocol for the BULLSEYE trial in which we aim to optimize antibiotic treatment during the initial 48 h of sepsis by comparing standard to double dosing of beta-lactam antibiotics. METHODS: This open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial will compare standard to double dosing of beta-lactam antibiotics (cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, flucloxacillin, meropenem, and piperacillin/clavulanic acid) in critically ill patients with septic shock. Participants will be randomized into two arms: the control arm receiving standard care, and the intervention arm receiving double antibiotic doses for 48 h, irrespective of renal function. Following this period, all patients will receive standard doses as per local protocol. The primary outcome is all cause 28-day mortality, with secondary outcomes including 90-day, 365-day, hospital and ICU mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, SOFA scores, time to shock reversal, microbiological eradication, clinical cure, pharmacodynamic target attainment, safety, quality of life, and medical consumption. DISCUSSION: The BULLSEYE trial aims to improve sepsis treatment in critically ill patients. Despite anticipated recruitment challenges, its large sample size ensures robust comparability. This pivotal trial could significantly impact sepsis treatment, leading to better clinical outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU_CT 2024-512950-13-00. Protocol version 2.3, protocol date 09-12-2024.

40118556,2024,"PURPOSE: Nearly 10% of the United States population has a reported penicillin allergy. However, many of these patients do not have true IgE-mediated allergy and are exposed to alternative antibiotics with increased risks of adverse outcomes, highlighting the importance of penicillin allergy testing. Patients with very low-risk penicillin allergies can safely undergo direct oral challenge (DOC) with a therapeutic dose of amoxicillin without prior skin testing. This study sought to establish a protocol for DOC in a primary care setting and test its efficacy and safety. METHODS: A standardized DOC protocol was developed at 2 primary care sites in Southeast Michigan. Forty-nine patients across the 2 sites were identified as having very low-risk penicillin allergies and underwent DOC. Follow up phone calls were completed 1 week and 6 months following DOC. RESULTS: All 49 patients had a negative DOC and successfully had their penicillin allergy delabeled from their electronic health record (EHR). No patients reported severe adverse reactions following DOC. All 22 patients who were successfully contacted 6 months after completing DOC reported willingness to take penicillin if prescribed in the future and believed they were no longer allergic to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that DOC may be effectively and safely implemented in a primary care setting to delabel penicillin allergies in patients with low-risk penicillin allergies. This study may serve as a model to increase access to DOC for adults in rural settings or low-income patient populations with limited access to allergy specialists.","[('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('IgE-mediated allergy', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergies', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergies', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('allergic', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DOC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergies', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergies', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DOC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('allergy', 'DISEASE')]"

We aimed to (1) develop a training program on antimicrobial use in veterinary companion animal medicine in Quebec, Canada, (2) quantify the impact of this training on the use of highly important antimicrobials, and (3) identify the factors that could limit such an impact. A total of 54 veterinarians from 35 veterinary facilities participated in the study. Antimicrobials were identified from electronic medical records, prescription rates were calculated and a difference-in-differences estimation was used to compare prescription rates pre- and post-training in 2023, controlling for seasonal trends during the same period in 2022. Participating veterinarians prescribed on average 11.7 antimicrobial treatments per 100 consultations. Two thirds of the systemic antimicrobials prescribed by participants were antimicrobials of very high medical importance, according to Health Canada. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most often prescribed antimicrobial and accounted for approximately 22 % of all prescriptions. The training had a limited impact on overall prescription rates. However, a reduction of 55 % in prescription rate was observed for metronidazole, which is most often prescribed in canine patients with acute diarrhea. Interviews were conducted with 11 participating veterinarians to identify obstacles to the implementation of recommended prescription practices.

40116564,2025,"BACKGROUND: The misuse of antibiotics in livestock farming has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which pose a serious threat to global animal and human health. Essential oils extracted from the leaves of Ocimum basilicum, Perilla frutescens and Mentha spicata contain bioactive compounds with bactericidal properties. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the bactericidal activity of Ocimum basilicum, Perilla frutescens and Mentha spicata essential oils and their combination with the antibiotic norfloxacin, against antibiotic-resistant Salmonella spp. isolated from diseased chickens. METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolated bacteria was conducted using the disc diffusion method. The bactericidal efficacy of essential oils and antibiotics was assessed by determining the minimum bactericidal concentration. The interaction between essential oils and antibiotics was analysed using the fractional bactericidal concentration index through the microdilution chequerboardtechnique. RESULTS: Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis were recovered from the organs of infected chickens. Isolated Salmonella spp. displayed significant resistance to amoxicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin and cefuroxime. The essential oils of Ocimum basilicum and Mentha spicata demonstrated similar minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of 8,000 microg/mL, while the essential oil of Perilla frutescens showed a higher MBC value of 10,000 microg/mL. Analysis of the interaction between these essential oils and norfloxacin indicated that both Ocimum basilicum and Mentha spicata exhibited a synergistic effect, whereas Perilla frutescens exhibited an additive effect when combined with norfloxacin in eradicating Salmonella spp. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that combining essential oils from three herbs with the antibiotic norfloxacin was highly effective in fighting antibiotic-resistant Salmonella spp. isolated from infected chickens.","[('norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('typhimurium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('streptomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MBC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40116072,2025,"Key characteristics (KCs) are properties of chemicals that are associated with different types of human health hazards. KCs are used for systematic reviews in support of hazard identification. Transcriptomic data are a rich source of mechanistic data and are frequently interpreted through ""enriched"" pathways/gene sets. Such analyses may be challenging to interpret in regulatory science because of redundancy among pathways, complex data analyses, and unclear relevance to hazard identification. We hypothesized that by cross-mapping pathways/gene sets and KCs, the interpretability of transcriptomic data can be improved. We summarized 72 published KCs across 7 hazard traits into 34 umbrella KC terms. Gene sets from Reactome and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were mapped to these, resulting in ""KC gene sets."" These sets exhibit minimal overlap and vary in the number of genes. Comparisons of the same KC gene sets mapped from Reactome and KEGG revealed low similarity, indicating complementarity. Performance of these KC gene sets was tested using publicly available transcriptomic datasets of chemicals with known organ-specific toxicity: benzene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin tested in mouse liver and drugs sunitinib and amoxicillin tested in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. We found that KC terms related to the mechanisms affected by tested compounds were highly enriched, while the negative control (amoxicillin) showed limited enrichment with marginal significance.

40115588,2025,"INTRODUCTION: The circulating GM antigen is considered an important and reliable biomarker according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSG) guidelines. However several possible causes of false-positive reactions have been reported, including intake of certain antibiotics, cross-reactivity with other fungi (e.g. Histoplasma capsulatum, Alternaria spp., Candida spp, and Fusarium spp etc), food (Carba beans and fava beans) and food supplements. In this context, the occurrence of false-positive results may lead to an unjustified invasive investigation and anti-fungal therapy. PURPOSE: The study was conducted to analyse of causal association of false positive galactomannan factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: BAL samples from suspected respiratory tract infections were submitted for direct microscopic examination, GM detection and fungal culture. RESULTS: Out of a total of 530 patients, 70 patients were in the case group (False positive GM) and 50 were in the control group (True positive). The average GMI of the case group was 2(1-4.2). and control group was 1.8(1-3.5). At a cut-off index of >1 false positive galactomannan results were observed maximum in patients who received Amoxiclav(48.5%), Piperacillin-tazobactam(33.3%), Amoxicillin(12.5%) followed by Meropenem(8.3%). The results showed a significant association(p-value <0.001) with false positive GM.. Other fungal agent colonization also had a higher GM index in the BAL sample but it is difficult to comment on association as the odds ratio was low (0.187). The odds were also lower (0.167) in dietary history to get false positive results and similarly with those on dietary supplements, but in contrast to these findings it was seen that the odd ratio was higher in patients suffering from tuberculosis(3.777) which can be attributed to increased colonization of aspergillus in TB patients. CONCLUSION: Galactomannan is the key biomarker of whether to start antifungal therapy for patients with IA and a higher mortality risk. Test results should be critically interpreted in the clinical context concerning potential causes of false-positive findings, especially with concomitant Piperacillin-tazobactam and amoxiclav use, other fungal infections and dietary history to prevent unnecessary antimycotic treatment.","[('GM', 'CHEMICAL'), ('respiratory tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('GM', 'CHEMICAL'), ('GM', 'CHEMICAL'), ('GM', 'CHEMICAL'), ('GM', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aspergillus', 'DISEASE'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('Piperacillin-tazobactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxiclav', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fungal infections', 'DISEASE')]"
40114765,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Postpartum women have relatively weaker bodies and may experience trauma during childbirth, providing opportunities for bacterial invasion. Therefore, there is indeed a certain risk of developing acute bacterial skin infections after childbirth. Postpartum acute bacterial skin infection can cause local or systemic symptoms, affect breastfeeding, and exacerbate the psychological and economic burden on patients. AIM: This study aimed to analyse pathogen resistance in patients with acute postpartum bacterial skin infections and the differences of T lymphocytes and inflammatory factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this case control study, a total of 100 patients with acute postpartum bacterial skin infections were selected as the experimental group. Another 100 healthy parturients were selected as the controls. The peripheral blood samples of the two groups were collected to detect the distribution of T lymphocyte subsets. The levels of inflammatory factors were detected. Separation and identification of pathogenic bacteria and drug sensitive test were performed in the experimental subjects. RESULTS: The pathogens and drug resistance: Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus were highly resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline, but sensitive to linezolid and vancomycin. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria were highly resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, aztreonam, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, and sensitive to imipenem. CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ were markedly higher, and Th17/Treg was markedly lower in the controls compared to the experimental subjects (p < 0.05). IL-4, IL-10, and hs-CRP in the experimental subjects were higher compared to the controls (p < 0.05).

This study evaluated the influence of supplementation with 2-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), or isomalto/malto-polysaccharides containing 87% of alpha(1-->6) linkages (IMMP-87), on the recovery of antibiotic-perturbed microbiota. The TIM-2 in vitro colon model inoculated with fecal microbiota of 9-month-old infants was used to simulate the colon of weaning infants exposed to the antibiotics amoxicillin/clavulanate or azithromycin. Both antibiotics induced changes in microbiota composition, with no signs of recovery in azithromycin-treated microbiota within 72 h. Moreover, antibiotic exposure affected microbiota activity, indicated by a low valerate production, and azithromycin treatment was associated with increased succinate production. The IMMP-87 supplementation promoted the compositional recovery of amoxicillin/clavulanate-perturbed microbiota, associated with the recovery of Ruminococcus, Ruminococcus gauvreauii group, and Holdemanella.

40111697,2025,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health concern, especially with regard to bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Dentists are responsible for approximately 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions. In addition, there seems to be a lack of awareness of potential resistance toward antiseptics and biocides such as chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) or cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), which are commonly used in dental practice but also included in over-the-counter products. In comparison to the gut microbiome, only a small number of studies have investigated the impact of antibiotics on the oral microbiome. Amoxicillin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic in dentistry, often used in combination with metronidazole. Several studies have addressed its impact on the oral microbiome. Similarly, the effects of ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, cephazolin, and benzylpenicillin have also been examined in various studies. However, due to variations in study designs, it is difficult to compare the effects of antibiotics on the oral microbiota, and conclusions can only be drawn at the phyla level. In contrast, studies on CPC and CHX have also focused on the genus level. The oral resistome mainly contains genes involved in resistance to macrolides, MLS(B) (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B), lincosamide and streptogramin A, fluoroquinolone, tetracycline, or penicillin. The oral cavity therefore serves as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which are of crucial importance both for inflammations in the oral cavity and for the treatment of the entire human organism.

Bacteriuria in pregnant and lactating HIV-infected women can cause serious complications to women and fetuses for pregnant women. Due to the importance of bacteriuria, we determined the etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and factors associated with bacteriuria in HIV-infected women. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study from January to April 2022 among HIV-infected women attending the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) clinic at Bukoba Municipality, Tanzania. Clean-catch midstream urine specimens were collected for culture on MacConkey and blood agars. We used colonial characteristics, Gram staining reactions, and biochemical tests to identify bacteria isolates. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. We used STATA version 15.0 for analysis. An association with bacteriuria was performed using modified poisson regressions. A p-value </= 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 290 participants, 66 (22.8%) had significant bacteriuria. The predominant bacteria isolates were Escherichia coli 21 (31.8%). Among gram-negative bacteria, 17 (34.0%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and 1 (25.0%) of Staphylococcus aureus were Methicillin-resistant. Escherichia coli showed a high rate of resistance against trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 21 (100%), and amoxicillin clavulanic acid 20 (95.0%).

The objective is to assess H. pylori infection in dyspeptic patients and compare various indicative tests. After approval, gastrointestinal biopsies and blood samples of 96 subjects exhibiting gastroduodenal symptoms were collected; both invasive and non-invasive tests were employed to analyse the samples. Results revealed 40 cases (41.67%) positive for H. pylori via histopathology and rapid urease testing, while 46 subjects tested positive for IgA and IgG antibodies via ELISA. Eighteen biopsies showed positivity in the culture test, corroborated by endoscopic examination and biochemical assessments (urease, catalase and oxidase). The isolates showed various degrees of resistance to antibiotics, while polymyxin B showed the highest (100%) followed by amoxicillin (88.90%) and kanamycin (77.78%). Additionally, the CagA gene presence was detected in 18 individuals through molecular methods. Sensitivity and specificity percentages (%) varied among diagnostic methods: histopathology (95/77), rapid urease (100/83.5), gram staining (85.7/90), IgG serology (100/66.6), IgA serology (100/79.5), PCR (100/75), RUT and IgG serology combination (100/79.04), and RUT, Gram staining and IgG serology combination (100/92.4), respectively. PCR emerged as the most reliable test. In the current investigation, other tests also exhibited high sensitivity and specificity values.

40102942,2025,"BACKGROUND: Glasser's disease, caused by Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis), is a widespread bacterial infection in swine that leads to significant economic losses. G. parasuis, a member of the normal microbiota within the Pasteurellaceae family, exhibits horizontal resistance gene exchange and intracellular invasion capabilities, increasing the risk of developing resistant isolates. Accurate antimicrobial therapy is essential for controlling Glasser's disease. The production systems for exotic crossbred pigs and Taiwan black pigs differ considerably. To inform Glasser disease control and monitor antimicrobial resistance, we assessed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of G. parasuis isolates, analyzed them using normalized resistance interpretation (NRI), and compared findings between the two production systems. RESULTS: A total of 154 G. parasuis isolates from 106 exotic crossbred pig herds and 48 Taiwan black pig herds were tested against 16 antimicrobial agents between 2015 and 2020. Due to the absence of specific breakpoints for G. parasuis, NRI was utilized to define non-wild-type (non-WT) populations based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions. Non-WT subpopulations of isolates for amoxicillin, ampicillin, ceftiofur, gentamicin, kanamycin, and tiamulin were observed. The highest MIC(90) (the concentration at which 90% of isolates were inhibited) was > 256 microg/mL for several antimicrobials, including gentamicin, kanamycin, lincomycin, lincospectin, spectinomycin, and tylosin. In contrast, the lowest MIC(90) was observed for ceftiofur (0.5 microg/mL). The MIC values for cephalothin were significantly higher in exotic crossbred pigs than in Taiwan black pigs (p = 0.0016). Conversely, MIC values for florfenicol were significantly higher in Taiwan black pigs than in exotic crossbred pigs (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the susceptibility profile of G. parasuis isolates for both exotic crossbred pigs and Taiwan black pigs in Taiwan and highlights potential antimicrobial resistance for aminocyclitol, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, lincosamides, macrolides, and pleuromulin. Ceftiofur, cephalothin, doxycycline, and florfenicol could be most suitable for treating early-stage Glasser's disease.

Diseases are one of the bottlenecks for the successful culture and production of this important species. Lactococcus garvieae is a Gram-positive coccus commonly found in aquatic environments causing fish and shellfish diseases. In the present investigation, we have isolated and characterized L. garvieae, as etiological agent of white muscle disease in freshwater prawn juveniles. The infected prawn samples showing clinical signs of opaque and whitish muscles, sluggishness and mortality were collected and processed. The isolated bacterium was identified using biochemical methods and 16s rDNA sequencing and species-specific PCR. The sequence obtained revealed > 99% identity with L. garvieae reported elsewhere. Koch's postulate was experimentally established through intramuscular challenge and the infected prawn muscle revealed massive coagulative necrosis with the presence of cocci. The isolate was found to be resistant to antibiotics namely clindamycin, cefoxitin, amoxicillin and co-trimoxazole. The heavy metal tolerance assay revealed the isolate to be tolerant to Cu(2+) and Cr(6+) and less tolerant to Hg(2+). Class I integron was also identified in L. garvieae isolate. Further, the isolate was screened for several virulence genes and found to have hemolysins 1, 2, and 3, adhesin PsaA, adhesin Pav, enolase, LPxTG 1, 3, and 4, adhesin clusters 1 and 2, and adhesin in the PCR assay.

40098545,2025,"AIM: This study builds on the environmental risk analysis presented in the 2022 National Report on Medicines Use in Italy by the Italian Medicines Agency and aims to assess the environmental risk posed by medicines in Italy and its regions. METHODS: The analysis selected 90 medicines based on three criteria: high utilization, low predicted no effect concentration (PNEC), and inclusion or candidacy for the European Watch List. For each medicine, the environmental risk was computed as the ratio between the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) and the PNEC. The PEC was derived following the approach of the Swedish Association of Pharmaceutical Industries and Italian drug utilization data. The risk was classified high if the ratio was greater than 10 and moderate if greater than 1. RESULTS: Overall, 13 medicines were identified as posing a high risk, including cardiovascular agents, antibiotics, analgesics, antidepressants and antiparasitic agents. The high risk was driven by either a very low PNEC (eg, estradiol and lacidipine) or high utilization (eg, amoxicillin, ibuprofen and diclofenac). Regional analysis showed higher risk due to high consumption for azithromycin and ofloxacin in central and southern Italy, and for levonorgestrel in northern Italy. CONCLUSION: This study points to the need for prioritizing targeted sampling in surface waters for medicines estimated at high risk. To prevent and mitigate the risk, a more conscious clinical practice coupled with appropriate waste management are required.","[('PEC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('antidepressants', 'CHEMICAL'), ('PNEC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('estradiol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('lacidipine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ibuprofen', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diclofenac', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levonorgestrel', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40097999,2025,"BACKGROUND: Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are common and severe surgical emergencies associated with high morbidity and mortality. In recent years, there has been a worldwide increase in antimicrobial resistance associated with intra-abdominal infections, responsible for a significant increase in mortality rates. To improve the quality of treatment, it is crucial to understand the underlying local epidemiology, clinical implications, and proper management of antimicrobial resistance, for both community- and hospital-acquired infections. The IRIS study (Italian Register of Complicated Intra-abdominal InfectionS) aims to investigate the epidemiology and initial management of complicated IAIs (cIAIs) in Italy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is a prospective, observational, nationwide (Italy), multicentre study. approved by the coordinating centre ethic committee (Local Research Ethics Committee of Pisa (Prot n 56478//2019). All consecutively hospitalized patients (older than 16 years of age) with diagnosis of cIAIs undergoing surgery, interventional drainage or conservative treatment have been included. RESULTS: 4530 patients included from 23 different Italian hospitals. Community Acquired infection represented the 70.9% of all the cases. Among appendicitis, we found that 98.2% of the cases were community acquired (CA) and 1.8% Healthcare-associated (HA) infections. We observed that CA represented the 94.2% and HA 5.8% of Gastro Duodenal perforation cases. The majority of HA infections were represented by colonic perforation and diverticulitis (28.3%) followed by small bowel occlusion (19%) and intestinal ischemia (18%). 27.8% of patients presented in septic shock. Microbiological Samples were collected from 3208 (70.8%) patients. Among 3041 intrabdominal sample 48.8% resulted positive. The major pathogens involved in intra-abdominal infections were found to be E.coli (45.6%). During hospital stay, empiric antimicrobial therapy was administered in 78.4% of patients. Amoxicillin/clavulanate was the most common antibiotic used (in 30.1% appendicitis, 30% bowel occlusion, 30.5% of cholecystitis, 51% complicated abdominal wall hernia, 55% small bowel perforation) followed by piperacillin/tazobactam (13.3% colonic perforation and diverticulitis, 22.6% cholecystitis, 24.2% intestinal ischemia, 28.6% pancreatitis). Empiric antifungal therapy was administered in 2.6% of patients with no sign of sepsis, 3.1% of patients with clinical sign of sepsis and 4.1% of patients with septic shock. Azoles was administered in 49.2% of patients that received empiric antifungal therapy. The overall mortality rate was 5.13% (235/4350). 16.5% of patients required ICU (748/4350). In accordance with mortality, it is important to highlight that 35.7% of small bowel perforation, 27.6% of colonic perforation and diverticulitis, 25.6% of intestinal ischemia and 24.6% of gastroduodenal complications required ICU. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic stewardship programs and correct antimicrobial and antimycotic prescription campaigns are necessary to ulteriorly improve the adequacy of drug usage and reduce the resistances burden.

Gut dysbiosis caused by antibiotics is a well-known phenomenon that has serious implications for gut microbiota-brain interactions. Although antibiotics disrupt the gut microbiota's fundamental structure, the mechanisms that modulate the response and their impact on brain function are still unclear. It is imperative to comprehend and investigate crucial regulators and factors that play important roles. We aimed to study the effect of long-term antibiotic-induced disruption of gut microbiota, host metabolomes, and brain function and, particularly, to determine the basic interactions between them by treating the C57BL/6 mice with two different, most commonly used antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin. Anxiety-like behavior was confirmed by the elevated plus-maze test and open field test. Gut microbes and their metabolite profiles in fecal, serum, and brain samples were determined by 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. In our study, long-term antibiotic treatment exerted anxiety-like effects. The fecal microbiota and metabolite status revealed that the top five genera found were Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Akkermansia, Ruminococcus_gnavus_group, and unclassified norank_f_Muribaculaceae. The concentration of serotonin, L-Tyrosine, 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan, L-Glutamic acid, L-Glutamate, 5-Hydroxyindole acetic acid, and dopaminergic synapsis was comparatively low, while adenosine was high in antibiotic-treated mice. The KEGG enrichment analysis of serum and brain samples showed that amino acid metabolism pathways, such as tryptophan metabolism, threonine metabolism, serotonergic synapsis, methionine metabolism, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, were significantly decreased in antibiotic-treated mice. Our study demonstrates that long-term antibiotic use induces gut dysbiosis and alters metabolic responses, leading to the dysregulation of brain signaling molecules and anxiety-like behavior. These findings highlight the complex interactions between gut microbiota and metabolic functions, providing new insights into the influence of microbial communities on gut-brain communication.","[('dysbiosis', 'DISEASE'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('serotonin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('L-Tyrosine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan', 'CHEMICAL'), ('L-Glutamic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('L-Glutamate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('5-Hydroxyindole acetic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('adenosine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amino acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tryptophan', 'CHEMICAL'), ('threonine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('methionine', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Each dog received a 250 mg AMX-CA tablet (formulation A or B) at a dosage of 20.5 +/- 2.5 mg/kg, with a 7-day washout period between treatments. Blood samples were collected over a 24-h period post-administration, then AMX and CA concentrations were measured using LC-MS/MS. Bioequivalence was assessed based on the 90% confidence intervals (CI) for peak plasma concentration (C(max)) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)), which required to fall within 80%-125%. RESULTS: The relative bioavailability of formulation B was 76.5% for AMX and 72.7% for CA, compared to formulation A.

OBJECTIVES: Assess cross-reactivity between betaL in non-immediate cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ni-CADRs). METHODS: Retrospective analysis (2000-2022) of patients with suspected ni-CADR with betaL as a possible culprit who underwent patch testing (PT) with an extended antibiotic series (10% pet., Chemotechnique Diagnostics or prepared in-house) according to European Society of Contact Dermatitis (ESCD) recommendations. Fisher exact test was used with a significance of 0.05 corrected for multiple testing; positive associations were quantified with odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Four hundred and fourteen patients (270 female/144 male; age 52 +/- 19 years) were included, mostly with maculopapular exanthema (367; 89%), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (22; 5%) and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) (12; 3%). Eighty-six patients (21%) had positive results to at least one drug. Fifty-eight patients (14%) had 110 positive results to betaL, mostly amoxicillin (33). Co-reactivity within penicillins was almost universal, including piperacillin with other penicillins (p = 0.007; OR 25; CI 3-56). There was co-reactivity to aminopenicillins and aminocephalosporins (p = 0.006; OR 33; CI 4-74) and within the cephalosporin subclass, including between aminocephalosporins and non-aminocephalosporins. Within carbapenems, 1 patient reacted to meropenem and ertapenem, with no extension to imipenem, as confirmed with a provocation test. Two patients reacted both to ceftriaxone and meropenem (p = 0.013; OR: 68; CI:15-612). CONCLUSION: PT is useful to confirm a probable culprit in ni-CADR to betaL. Co-reactivity, interpreted mostly as cross-reactivity, occurred within cephalosporin and, particularly, with penicillin subclasses, including between piperacillin-tazobactam and remaining penicillins, which has seldom been described. There was no association between penicillins and cephalosporins as a whole, except between aminopenicillins and aminocephalosporins, attributable to a similar lateral chain amino group.

However, limited information is available regarding the direct link between antimicrobial use (AMU), dairy hygiene practices, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Salmonella strains isolated from dairy products in Bishoftu town. METHODS: Cross-sectional research was done from October 2023 to April 2024 to assess dairy farmers' antimicrobial usage (AMU) and hygiene practices and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of Salmonella isolated from raw cow milk and its products. A structured questionnaire was also used to assess the milk value chain's knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) regarding AMU, AMR, and hygiene practices. Salmonella isolation and identification was conducted using standard microbiological techniques and further confirmation was carried out using the OmniLog system. An antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique..Data was analyzed using STATA version 14.2. RESULTS: Among 41 dairy farmers interviewed, it was found that most of the respondents had sufficient knowledge (78%), desired attitudes (90%), and good practices (76%) regarding AMU and AMR. However, 36% of dairy farms had poor hygienic practices. Overall, 2% (n = 4) of the samples tested positive for S. enterica. Of the 4 isolates, 3 were identified in dairy farm samples, whereas 1 was isolated from milk vendors. However, no Salmonella was identified in cheese or yoghurt samples obtained from the restaurants. Regarding the AMR profile, S. enterica isolates were resistant to amoxicillin (75%), streptomycin (75%), and tetracycline (50%). Resistant to two or more antimicrobials were identified in 75% of the isolates. CONCLUSION: This study indicated contamination of cow milk and its products with S. enterica.

40084725,2025,"BACKGROUND: Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES) is a recently defined clinical entity, first described in 2014. DIES is a hypersensitivity reaction with non-IgE mechanisms involving the gastrointestinal tract, occurring 1 to 4 hours after drug ingestion. Antibiotics are most commonly responsible, particularly amoxicillin or amoxicillin / clavulanic acid (AMX/CL). The main criterion is recurrent, often uncontrollable vomiting occurring 1-4 hours after drug ingestion, without classic IgE-mediated allergic symptoms such as cutaneous or respiratory reactions. To the best of our knowledge, 10 pediatric cases of DIES have been described in the literature. CASE PRESENTATIONS: A 4-year-old male and a 14-year-old male presented to our pediatric allergy clinic with a suspected hypersensitivity reaction to AMX/CL, and their specific IgE tests for penicillin G and penicillin V were negative. The younger patient was also tested for specific IgE against amoxicillin and ampicillin, which were also negative. Skin prick tests and intradermal test with AMX/CL were negative in both patients, but oral provocation testing with AMX/CL resulted in abdominal pain, vomiting and lethargy, confirming the diagnosis of DIES. CONCLUSIONS: DIES should be considered in patients presenting with vomiting and lethargy following drug ingestion, particularly when IgE-mediated allergies have been ruled out. Early recognition and appropriate management, including drug provocation testing in a controlled setting, are crucial to ensure optimal patient outcomes. By presenting these two rare cases, we aim to raise awareness and deepen the understanding of DIES among healthcare professionals, which could contribute to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes.","[('Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome', 'DISEASE'), ('hypersensitivity', 'DISEASE'), ('non-IgE', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin / clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX/CL', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vomiting', 'DISEASE'), ('IgE-mediated allergic symptoms', 'DISEASE'), ('cutaneous or respiratory reactions', 'DISEASE'), ('allergy', 'DISEASE'), ('hypersensitivity', 'DISEASE'), ('AMX/CL', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin G', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX/CL', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX/CL', 'CHEMICAL'), ('abdominal pain', 'DISEASE'), ('vomiting', 'DISEASE'), ('lethargy', 'DISEASE'), ('vomiting', 'DISEASE'), ('lethargy', 'DISEASE'), ('IgE-mediated allergies', 'DISEASE')]"

40080272,2025,"The use of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) has enhanced life quality and longevity but poses significant environmental risks to ecosystems and human health. Evidence-based risk assessments are essential for addressing these issues, requiring detailed data on API presence, behavior, and effects in the environment. In particular, predictive exposure models offer a cost-effective tool to support such investigations. This study focuses on the application of a multimedia level III fugacity model to estimate the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) and to simulate transport, distribution, and persistence of nine APIs in the Venice Lagoon (Italy), a transitional environment subjected to multiple anthropogenic stressors. Concentrations of the studied APIs in water were estimated within one order of magnitude of measured data, while the model underestimated the concentration of azithromycin and 17-beta-estradiol in the sediments due to water half-life overestimation and lack of information about unmonitored emission sources. In detail, the highest levels of APIs in the water were estimated for amoxicillin and clarithromycin, while sediments showed a significant presence of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. Model results also showed the possibility for sediments to act as sink for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, estrone, and 17-beta-estradiol. For all target APIs, degradation in the water column and adjective outflow were the most important elimination processes, while degradation in the sediments was significant only for erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin. Monte-Carlo uncertainty and sensitivity analysis showed that degradation in water, affinity to organic matter, and sediment dynamics were the parameters with the strongest influence on model's results.

Its incidence is probably underestimated, as specific diagnostic tools are currently lacking. Over 1000 known drugs cause DILI, and the list is expanding. The aim of this review is to describe DILI pathogenesis and emphasize the drugs accountable for child DILI in order to aid its recognition. Intrinsic DILI is well described in terms of mechanism, incriminated drugs, and toxic dose. Conversely, idiosyncratic DILI (iDILI) is unpredictable, occurring as a result of a particular response to drug administration, and its occurrence cannot be foreseen in clinical studies. Half of pediatric iDILI cases are linked to antibiotics, mostly amoxicillin-clavulanate, in the immune-allergic group, while autoimmune DILI is the hallmark of minocycline and nitrofurantoin. Secondly, antiepileptics are responsible for 20% of pediatric iDILI cases, children being more prone to iDILI caused by these agents than adults. A similar tendency was observed in anti-tuberculosis drugs, higher incidences being reported in children below three years old. Current data show growing cases of iDILI related to antineoplastic agents, atomoxetine, and albendazole, so that it is advisable for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion regarding iDILI.","[('liver injury', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('acute liver failure', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('autoimmune DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('minocycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('atomoxetine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('albendazole', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40075884,2025,"Background/Objective: Bacteriological culture has been a widely used method for the detection of meningococcus, but it has low sensitivity and a long turnaround time. Molecular detection targeting capsule transport A (ctrA) gene has been used, but over 16% of meningococcal carriage isolates lack ctrA, resulting in false-negative reports. The Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase gene (sodC) is specific to N. meningitidis, and is not found in other Neisseria species, making it a useful target for improved detection of non-groupable meningococci without intact ctrA. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance compassion of two in-house PCR methods, sodC gene- and ctrA gene-based PCR assays, for detecting N. meningitidis in asymptomatic carriers. The secondary objective was to assess antimicrobial resistance profiling of N. meningitidis isolates. Methods: The performance of sodC gene-based PCR assay compared to ctrA gene-based PCR for detection of N. meningitidis was evaluated using clinical samples (pharyngeal swabs; n = 137) collected from suspected asymptomatic carriers and culture-confirmed meningococci isolates (n = 49). Additionally, the antimicrobial sensitivity of the 49 isolates against antimicrobial drugs was determined using a disk diffusion test. Result: Of 49 DNA samples from culture-positive N. meningitidis isolates, the sodC gene-based PCR accurately identified all 49, whereas the ctrA gene-based PCR identified only 33 out of 49. Of 137 pharyngeal swabs, the sodC gene-based assay detected N. meningitidis DNA in 105 (76.6%), while the ctrA-based assay detected N. meningitidis DNA in 64 (46.7%). Out of the 49 N. meningitidis isolates, 43 (87.8%) were resistant to amoxicillin, 42 (83.7%) to ampicillin, 32 (65.3%) to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 22 (44.9%) to ceftazidime, 18 (36.7%) to ceftriaxone, and 7 (15.2%) to meropenem. Additionally, the majority of the isolates, 36 (73.5%), were sensitive to cefepime, 31 (63.3%) to ceftriaxone and meropenem, and 26 (53.1%) to ceftazidime. Conclusions: The findings of this study highlight the necessity of adopting non-capsular sodC-based PCR to replace ctrA in resource-constrained laboratories to improve N. meningitidis detection, and underscore the importance of periodic antimicrobial resistance surveillance to inform and adapt treatment strategies.","[('Cu-Zn superoxide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sodC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sodC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sodC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefepime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Ecological security and financial issues demand a look for innovative approaches to leather dehairing free from pollution. The primary goal of this investigation was to explore keratinolytic protease producing bacteria from tannery waste, their genomic evaluation and to assess their possible use in the dehairing process. A newly isolated Gram-negative bacterium (LRI-TA6) was characterized and checked for its keratinolytic protease producing ability. The strain was identified as Chryseobacterium cucumeris through whole genome sequencing. The genome was 4,541,898 bp in size and contain 4,426 protein coding sequences (CDS) with 36.38 % of GC content. Twenty-five open reading frames (CDS) were found as protease producing genes notably DegQ (serine protease), DegS, and ATP-dependent protease DP (EC 3.4.21.-). The isolate revealed enzyme production throughout an extended pH range of 5.0 to 8.0, and a broad temperature range of 10  degrees C to 38  degrees C. The isolate LRI-TA6 was sensitive to all five antibiotics (amoxicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin) with zone diameter ranges from 17.2 +/- 0.8 to 32 +/- 0.0 mm. The enzyme was shown to have 29.9 +/- 6.7 and 83.6 +/- 0.2 U/ml of keratinolytic and proteolytic activity, respectively. By employing crude keratinase, the removal of hair from goat skin was accomplished in 18 h. This study is the first report to isolate and characterize C. cucumeris from tannery waste and also the amazing 18 h dehairing capabilities and thus might be utilized for further studies towards commercial synthesis of keratinase for use in leather processing sectors.","[('Lime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Na(2)S', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40072769,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Most epidemiological studies have found antibiotics to be the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). It is unclear what the risk of DILI is associated with different antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the frequency of DILI due to the most commonly used antibiotics among inpatients, in a population-based setting. METHODS: Patients who were treated with the 14 most-used antibiotics at Landspitali University Hospital Iceland 2012-2023, with concomitant: > 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or > 2 x ULN of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were identified. If DILI was a potential cause, the Revised Electronic Causality Assessment Method (RECAM) method was used to determine likelihood of DILI. RESULTS: Overall 2292 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 52 of whom were found to have DILI, median age 67 (range 21-93) years, 58% females, 17 (33%) with jaundice and three (5.8%) died of liver failure. The most commonly implicated agent was amoxicillin/clavulanate (n = 23) in 1:1327 users (0.075%), ceftriaxone (n = 8) 1:3779 (0.02%), cefazolin (n = 7) 1: 6363 (0.016%), cloxacillin 1:6024 (n = 4) (0.017%), piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 2) 1:1551 (0.097%), vancomycin (n = 2) 1:1966 (0.076%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) (n = 3) 1:1096 (0.091%) and ciprofloxacin (n = 1) 1:10,938 (0.009%). In two cases, more than one antibiotic was considered likely. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-induced liver injury was found to be a rare adverse effect of antibiotics in a population-based setting. Overall, 33% presented with jaundice but three died of liver failure, all due to amoxicillin/clavulanate, which was the most common cause occurring in around 1 in 1300 users.

40071954,2025,"Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 23B, a non-vaccine serotype, has shown an increasing prevalence and penicillin non-susceptibility among carriage and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) isolates. Recently, a novel penicillin non-susceptible genotype has emerged, named 23B1. In the framework of the Belgian pneumococcal carriage study, we studied the prevalence of 23B(0)/23B1 among 586 23B strains (2016-2022) in 172 day care centers from 6- to 30-month-old children and among 130 pediatric 23B IPD isolates (2007-2021). Pneumococci were whole genome sequenced to determine the capsular polysaccharide genotype and sequence type (ST). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing determined penicillin and amoxicillin MICs, as well as resistance to co-trimoxazole and levofloxacin. 23B carriage was stable during 2016 ̶ 2022 except in the 2020-2021 winter season when it increased. The proportion of genotype 23B1 compared to 23B(0) decreased from 2016 ̶ to 2022 but remained consistently higher than 23B(0). In 2020-2021, an increase in the proportion of 23B1 was reflected in an overall increase in 23B carriage. All increases in 23B IPD cases were almost entirely driven by 23B1. The median penicillin MICs were significantly different for 23B(0) (0.03 mg/L) and 23B1 (0.25 mg/L). In 2021, increased intermediate levofloxacin susceptibility was noted in 23B. 23B1-associated ST2372 was the most prevalent ST in carriage and IPD during 2013-2022. We show that an increase in 23B carriage among children was paralleled in pediatric IPD in Belgium, reiterating the utility of pneumococcal surveillance in the day care population. Serotype 23B is reported worldwide as an important pediatric non-PCV13 serotype with reduced penicillin susceptibility, with 23B1 as the presumed driver for the increased prevalence.IMPORTANCEDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the 23B serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae has increased in prevalence in healthy carriage isolates from Belgian day care centers and pediatric (younger than 18 years of age) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) isolates. Additionally, an increase in penicillin non-susceptibility was also observed within this serotype. Recently, a genetic variant of 23B, named 23B1, was discovered, which is known to be related to decreased penicillin susceptibility. We showed that increases in 23B prevalence in healthy carriage and IPD cases always coincided with 23B1 expansions, leading to higher penicillin non-susceptibility rates. Increases in 23B in the day care population paralleled pediatric 23B IPD increases, indicating the vital role of day care monitoring of pneumococcal carriage. Countries should stay vigilant for prevalence increases in S. pneumoniae serotype 23B, given the decreased susceptibility to penicillin and co-trimoxazole of the 23B1 variant.","[('non-vaccine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin non-susceptibility', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin non-susceptible', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-trimoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('IPD', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('IPD', 'DISEASE'), ('IPD', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pandemic', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin non-susceptibility', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('IPD', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin non-susceptibility', 'CHEMICAL'), ('IPD', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-trimoxazole', 'CHEMICAL')]"

RESULTS: Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as the primary typing method, the isolates were classified into 13 distinct clusters, revealing a dominant pattern that has persisted for over twenty years.

40069699,2025,"BACKGROUND: The nose is the primary colonization site of S. aureus which is a known risk factor for causing S. aureus infection. Evaluating the knowledge, attitudes, and actual practice of dental students is imperative to put together guidelines on how to achieve adequate infection control when treating patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitude regarding Methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) and compliance to hygiene practices. And to determine the nasal carriage rate of S.aureus and MRSA and identifying the associated factors for S.aureus and MRSA nasal colonization among dental students in Al-Quds University- Palestine. METHODS: Two-hundred eighty (280) dental students from Al-Quds University dental school were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional survey and undergo nasal sampling of MRSA. The survey included demographic questions, eight questions about knowledge, eight questions about attitudes/perceptions and six questions about practices/behaviors regarding MRSA infection control. Nasal samples from the participants were analyzed for MRSA presence and antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Among the 280 dental students, 68 (24.3%) were S. aureus nasal carriers, whereas 21 (7.5%) were MRSA nasal carriers. Among 21 tested MRSA isolates, resistance to amoxicillin was most common (100%), followed by resistance to amoxicillin / Clavulanic acid (28.5%). Five isolates (23.8%) were found resistant to erythromycin, four isolates (19%) were resistant to clindamycin, and three isolates (14.2%) were resistant to gentamicin. None of the MRSA isolates were resistant to vancomycin. Risk factors such as using antibiotics within the previous six months, visiting a hospital recently, having a previous Staphylococcus bacterial infection and having a member of the family working in healthcare were significantly associated with carrier status (P < 0.05). The knowledge score suggests that dental students had intermediate knowledge regarding MRSA, while the attitude score showed that dental students had positive attitudes towards MRSA infection control, and the practice score suggests that the dental students' practices regarding MRSA infection prevention are good. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MRSA nasal colonization among the dental student population was higher than that reported in the Palestinian population. This indicates that the implementation of strategies on interfering with the transmission of MRSA is of utmost importance. In addition, further educating dental students on MRSA is needed to improve MRSA infection control in the dental setting.","[('S. aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('S. aureus infection', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('S.aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('S.aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('S. aureus nasal carriers', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin / Clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacterial infection', 'DISEASE'), ('MRSA infection', 'DISEASE'), ('MRSA infection', 'DISEASE'), ('MRSA infection', 'DISEASE')]"

40062336,2025,"Neurosurgical patients, including those with severe traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke, or raised intracranial pressure, are at heightened risk for stress ulcers and aspiration pneumonitis, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. These patients are typically managed through both pharmacological interventions [e.g., proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine 2 (H2) antagonists, sucralfate] and non-pharmacological measures (e.g., nasogastric decompression, patient positioning) to mitigate adverse outcomes. The pathogenesis of stress ulcers in neurosurgical patients is multifactorial, but the routine use of stress ulcer prophylaxis remains controversial. While gastric acid suppression with H2 receptor antagonists and PPIs is commonly employed, concerns have arisen regarding the association between elevated gastric pH, bacterial colonization, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The lack of comprehensive data on gastroprotection in critically ill neurosurgical patients, who face a greater risk than non-neurosurgical counterparts, further complicates this issue. Recent studies, such as one by Gao et al on the efficacy of vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy in elderly patients, highlight the potential of novel therapies, but the influence of pre-existing conditions like Helicobacter pylori infection remains unclear.

A 68-year-old man was hospitalized for impaired consciousness, left hemiparesis, and aphasia, consistent with meningoencephalitis. A CT scan showed otomastoiditis and bilateral pulmonary consolidations with respiratory failure. A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed endocardial vegetations at the mitral-aortic junction and left ventricular outflow tract, requiring aortic valve replacement. He also developed septic arthritis in both prosthetic hips and bilateral muscular abscesses. The second patient is a 50-year-old man who was hospitalized for lumbar back pain, aphasia, left-sided neglect, and a motor deficit in the right lower limb. A CT scan showed spondylodiscitis at the L5-S1 level, an abscess in the right frontal region (both confirmed on MRI), and bilateral pulmonary consolidations.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen involved in pyomyositis, but Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus (GBS)) can cause pyomyositis. We herein present a case of pyomyositis of the right gluteus maximus caused by GBS bacteremia (primary bacteremia). An 81-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus presented with warmth and painful swelling of the right lateral buttock. Computed tomographic (CT) images revealed swelling of the right gluteus maximus without an abscess, but soft tissue inflammation was apparent. The exploratory incision findings excluded necrotizing soft tissue infection. On day 2, two sets of blood cultures taken on admission grew Streptococcus agalactiae alone. Thus, pyomyositis caused by GBS was diagnosed. The patient received intravenous ampicillin therapy for two weeks. However, CT images revealed a new area of fluid accumulation in the right gluteus maximus, and no pus was aspirated during ultrasound-guided puncture. Following an additional week of intravenous ampicillin and four weeks of oral amoxicillin, the lesions resolved without surgical debridement. The present case is unique in that the patient developed pyomyositis due to GBS.

40061923,2025,"Antibiotics are widely used all over the world for different uses including treatment and livestock activities. Unfortunately, these emerging contaminants can enter the water sources and pollute the environment, if improperly managed. Therefore, the present study was developed to investigate the removal efficiency of amoxicillin (AMX) from aqueous solutions using the US/PS/CuO-Fe(3)O(4) process. An ultrasonic bath (S60H, Elma) with a capacity of 6 L equipped with frequency of 37 kHz was used at the present study. The chemical structure and surface morphology of CuO-Fe(3)O(4) nanocatalyst were characterized by BET, VSM, XRD, FE-SEM and FTIR analysis. The experimental runs were designed based on Box-Behnken design (BBD) with five input parameters. The results obtained from the present study indicated that increased CuO-Fe(3)O(4) dosage and reaction time increased the AMX removal efficiency. According to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the predicted second-order model, pH and AMX concentration were identified as the most critical parameters in oxidation process and AMX removal efficiency. Under the optimal conditions (pH = 3.3, reaction time = 60 min, initial AMX concentration = 13 mg/L, persulfate = 0.67 g/L and CuO-Fe(3)O(4) dosage = 0.7 g/L), the highest removal efficiency for AMX (98.1 %), COD (73 %) and TOC (65 %) were achieved. Based on ANOVA and the predicted second-order model, the CuO-Fe(3)O(4) and reaction time were identified as the most important positive parameters in the oxidation efficiency of AMX.

This research investigates the enhancement activity of TiO(2) photocatalyst codoped with N and Cu from urea and electroplating wastewater respectively as sources, for photodegradation of amoxicillin (AMX) residual in water media. The synthesis of codoped TiO(2) photocatalyst has been done through sol-gel process to determine the optimal concentration for each single dopant of Cu and N based on the highest band gap energy (E (g)) narrowing and their performance in photodegradation of AMX. The synthesized photocatalysts are investigated by material characterization. The effect of the double dopants on the photocatalyst activity was examined through photodegradation of AMX. The optimum N and Cu dopant concentrations were 30 and 0.60 wt %, giving E (g) values of 2.88 and 2.93 eV, respectively. This ratio is used to synthesize the codoping photocatalyst that significantly reduces E (g) in 2.74 eV with AMX photodegradation reaching 95.76%.

40060788,2025,"As the environment becomes increasingly polluted, there is a pressing need for the development of effective remediation technologies, particularly in the area of wastewater treatment. Recently, there has been growing interest in advanced oxidation systems (AOSs) based on renewable solar energy. This study focuses on the investigation of photoelectrochemical (PEC) AOSs using WO(3) and WO(3)/BiVO(4) photoanodes and an environmentally friendly aqueous sulfate electrolyte for visible light-induced decomposition of pharmaceutical compounds, namely, diclofenac (DCF), amoxicillin (AMX), and tetracycline (TCC). It was demonstrated that in contrast to conventional persulfate-based advanced oxidation processes, where S(2)O(8) (2-) is activated by UV, ultrasound, or thermal energy to generate highly reactive radical species, in photoelectrochemical systems reported here, radicals were generated by the interaction of photogenerated holes with H(2)O molecules and SO(4) (2-) ions. These processes eventually led to the formation of S(2)O(8) (2-) with an estimated Faradaic efficiency of 70-80%. Persulfate has also been shown to contribute to the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds, particularly diclofenac. The degradation efficiencies of AMX, TCC, and DCF were 10-14, 19-21, and 75-80%, respectively, in both PEC-AOSs studied. The formation of the WO(3)/BiVO(4) heterojunction enhanced charge carrier separation and stability of the photoanode, but the effect on the pharmaceutical decomposition efficiency was not significant. The mechanism of visible light-induced generation of persulfate in the studied PEC systems was analyzed on the basis of thermodynamic considerations and experimental observations of pH variation during photoelectrolysis.","[('sulfate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diclofenac', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DCF', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Persulfate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diclofenac', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DCF', 'CHEMICAL'), ('persulfate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('PEC', 'CHEMICAL')]"

We assessed the prescribing patterns of antibiotics in three public primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) in Maseru, Lesotho. OBJECTIVES: A cross-sectional point prevalence survey was employed using patients' prescription booklets from October 2022 to December 2022. METHOD: Antibiotics were categorised according to the World Health Organization (WHO) AWaRe classification and assessed by Defined Daily Dose (DDD)/100 outpatients/day to measure relative consumption of each antibiotic as a percentage of total consumption, Access-to-Watch index (AW-I) and Amoxicillin Index (A-I). RESULTS: Of the 624 participants (median age 35 [interquartile range IQR: 45-26] years), 71.5% (n = 446) were female. Overall mean (standard deviation [s.d.]) antibiotic consumption was 1.48 (0.13) DDD/100 outpatients/day, with PHCC-1 at 1.64, PHCC-2 at 1.33 and PHCC-3 at 1.47 DDD/100 outpatients/day. The median (IQR) AW-I was 4.64 (3.42-9.45) and the A-I was 1.41 (0.87-1.95). The most frequently prescribed Access group antibiotics included amoxicillin (PHCC-2: 45.9%, overall 1.33 DDD/100 outpatients/day; PHCC-3: 24.5%, 1.47 DDD/100 outpatients/day, and PHCC-1: 23.2%, 1.64 DDD/100 outpatients/day) and doxycycline (PHCC-3: 29.9%, 1.47 DDD/100 outpatients/day, 24.1%, PHCC-2: 1.33 DDD/100 outpatients/day). Erythromycin was the most prescribed Watch group antibiotic for all PHCCs. CONCLUSION: High consumption of Access-group antibiotics was observed. The Watch group's antibiotic use, particularly erythromycin, requires the implementation of stewardship programmes. Results may be a baseline for establishing antibiotic stewardship in Lesotho's PHCCs.

40059062,2025,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a common pathogen that has co-evolved with the human host for approximately 100,000 years; however, our understanding of its population structure remains limited. Furthermore, the detailed characteristics of its virulence factors and antibiotic resistance for H. pylori are not yet fully elucidated. METHODS: In this study, we curated a global genome dataset of 4067 H. pylori isolates from 76 countries and explored H. pylori characteristics, including population genetic structure, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance. We used three approaches (fineSTRUCTURE, ADMIXTURE, and DAPC) to infer the population structure of H. pylori. We investigated the virulence of each isolate by calling genotypes of cagA and vacA and evaluated the correlations of virulence factors with subpopulation. For antibiotic resistance, we identified mutations to determine the genotypic antibiotic resistance. Then we estimated the prevalence of genotypic antibiotic resistance grouped by geographical location, subpopulation, and study period. RESULT: We identified 21 subpopulations in 4067 H. pylori isolates, including 20 previously reported subpopulations and a novel subpopulation hspEuropeIsrael, and found that the population structure of H. pylori was geographically restricted. The novel subpopulation hspEuropeIsrael had a higher proportion of less virulent cagA and vacA genotypes compared to other subpopulations. After evaluating the rates of H. pylori genotypic resistance to four antibiotics, we found that the prevalence of genotypic resistance to amoxicillin and metronidazole was > 15% across all five continents. Genotypic resistance to levofloxacin was > 15% on all continents except for Oceania. Additionally, the genotypic resistance rate to clarithromycin was > 15% in Asia, Europe, and Oceania. A trend of increased genotypic resistance over time was observed in several continents during subgroup analyses. Furthermore, we constructed a comprehensive database for H. pylori, named Helicobacter Pylori Encyclopedia for Research (HELPER, http://ccra.njmu.edu.cn/helper). CONCLUSION: Our results provide a detailed characterization of H. pylori and extend previous schemas. HELPER serves as an informative and comprehensive database that will be a valuable resource for researchers and lay the foundation for future studies on H. pylori.","[('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE')]"

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate the eradication efficacy of H. pylori and the safety and treatment compliance among of 637 patients with refractory H. pylori infection in our center over the past 10 years. Risk factors affecting efficacy of H. pylori eradication were evaluated. Results: The overall eradication rate, incidence of adverse reactions and medication percentage of 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy were 92.3%, 40.3% and 92.2%, respectively. The eradication rate, incidence of adverse reactions, and proportion of administered treatments were as follows: 87.3%, 36.4% and 92.7% for amoxicillin+metronidazole; 91.1%, 39.2% and 93.7% for amoxicillin+tetracycline; 92.9%, 23.8% and 94.0% for amoxicillin+furazolidone; 92.1%, 47.1% and 90.0% for tetracycline+metronidazole; 94.5%, 41.7% and 92.0% for tetracycline+furazolidone, and 91.3%, 46.3% and 92.5% for furazolidone+metronidazole.

40047444,2025,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections in humans. They are mainly caused by Escherichia coli and other Enterobacterales for which increasing resistance to antibiotics and in particular to beta-lactams is extensively reported. The detection of beta-lactam resistance phenotypes is currently time-consuming (18 h). Hence, most treatments are given without any results of antibiotic susceptibility testing and may involve broad-spectrum antibiotics. A biochemical diagnostic test has been developed to rapidly evaluate the production of beta-lactamases (and consequently the beta-lactam resistance) from cultures (10(4) and 10(5) CFU/mL) of Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates representative of bacterial species as a source of UTIs (n = 112). It relies on a centrifugation step after a 90 min preliminary culture and the detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin as substrate using a special filter. Overall, the test gave a positive result for 87.6% of the tested resistant strains with a bacterial load of 10(5) CFU/mL, and a positive result for 100% of tested extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and for carbapenemase producers at the same load. This cost-effective test can be performed in any laboratory and ultimately shall be tested at the patient side and at the general practitioner. Its turn-around-time to get results is less than 2 h. After further improvements, the results obtained with this proof-of-concept test suggest that its use may contribute to rapidly guide the treatment of non-complicated UTIs and, therefore, limit the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. IMPORTANCE: This work reports on a totally novel diagnostic technique, the Rapid Amp NP test for the identification of amoxicillin/ampicillin resistance in bacteria that are sources of non-complicated urinary tract infections. Those preliminary results obtained with cultured bacteria are promising. We believe its future use may contribute to reconsider aminopenicillins as a first line therapy for treating UTI infections.

The authors hypothesize that adjunctive systemic antibiotics will decrease systemic inflammation and subsequently improve glucose control. Baseline periodontal examinations and haematological tests were performed for all subjects. Subsequently, subgingival scaling and root planning (SRP) procedures were performed by a single periodontist for both the test and control groups. The test group received 500 mg amoxicillin and 200 mg metronidazole TDS for 7 days in the same week of the SRP procedure. Three months later, periodontal examinations were repeated by blinded examiners and haematological tests were repeated. Maintenance periodontal therapy was provided at this time. CASE SELECTION: A convenience sample of patients visiting the periodontal department between 2016-2022 was used. Participants included were aged 40-75; diagnosed with T2DM for >2 years; HbA1c of 6.5-10%, had stable medication regimens and >15 remaining teeth. Participants had a periodontal diagnosis of generalized severe chronic periodontitis or stage III-IV generalized periodontitis based on the 1999 and 2018 classifications respectively. Exclusion criteria related to coexisting inflammatory or infectious diseases (e.g. malignancy, coronary heart disease or hepatitis); adjustment in diet or glycaemic control strategy; severe diabetic complications; pregnancy or lactation; allergies to amoxicillin or metronidazole; periodontal treatment or antibiotics within 3 months prior; smoking and alcohol abuse. The primary clinical outcome was a change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included the effect on periodontal parameters and haematological markers of inflammation. DATA ANALYSIS: Periodontal parameters measured were probing depth (PD), bleeding index (BI), Plaque index (PI), periodontally inflamed surface area (PISA), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Haematological parameters were glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and white blood cell (WBC) count. For data analysis, poorly controlled T2DM was defined as baseline HbA1c > 7.5%. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Analysis within and between the two groups was analysed with Student's t-tests when data followed a normal distribution and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data. Chi-square testing was used to compare categorical variables. Uni- and multivariable binary logistic regression was employed to analyze the effectors related to HbA1c decrease. Intention-to-treat analysis was carried out for all enroled participants. RESULTS: 49 participants were enroled in the study; 23 were assigned to the SRP-only group and 26 to the SRP + antibiotics group. Nine participants were lost to follow-up. HbA1c levels decreased significantly after treatment in both the SRP group (7.6 +/- 0.98% vs. 7.22 +/- 0.88%, p = 0.001) and the SRP + antibiotics group (7.95 +/- 1.23% vs 7.42 +/- 1.14%, p = 0.004). Following multivariable regression analysis, female sex, adjunctive antibiotic use and high baseline HbA1c levels were associated with a greater decrease in HbA1c levels following periodontal therapy (OR = 9.358, 95%CI: 1.863-47.015; OR = 4.551, 95%CI: 1.012-20.463; OR = 7.162, 95% CI:1.359-37.753). Periodontal parameters significantly improved by a similar amount in both groups after treatment (p < 0.05). When the baseline PD was >6 mm, the SRP+ antibiotic group had more sites of improvement in PD than the SRP only group (698 sites vs 545 sites, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: SRP alone and SRP with adjunctive antibiotics both proved beneficial for improving glycaemic control and periodontal health at 3 months following periodontal therapy. Participants with baseline HbA1c > 7.5% were more likely to show an improvement in HbA1c when receiving adjunctive antibiotics.

Effective empiric antimicrobial therapy is crucial, but there is no consensus on the optimal regimen. This study aimed to document antimicrobial regimens used in the Netherlands and to evaluate culture results from AL after esophagectomy at our center. METHODS: An online questionnaire about the preferred antimicrobial treatment of AL after esophagectomy was sent to all upper gastrointestinal surgeons in the Netherlands. In addition, drain culture results from patients with AL after esophagectomy in our center were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: From 76 responses, 28 were included, representing 13 of the 15 esophagectomy-performing centers in the Netherlands. For treating AL after esophagectomy, respondents typically choose broad-spectrum regimens covering Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria. The cultures of 57 patients were analyzed. Overall, 61% had positive cultures for yeast, 61% of patients for Enterobacterales, and 16% for Pseudomonas and other non-fermenters. CONCLUSION: Based on the studied cultures, empiric antibiotics should cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative, anaerobe bacteria and Pseudomonas. We recommend the use of empiric amoxicillin/clavulanic acid with tobramycin for patients with AL after esophagectomy, which is now protocol in our center. The addition of antifungals remains debatable.

40041666,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Poultry products are considered an important source of Salmonella infections. Transmission of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars to humans has been a great concern worldwide. Occurrence of multi-drug resistance, adding to the presence of various virulence factors, which facilitate the pathogenesis of Salmonella, would cause tremendous risk for both human and animals' health. METHODS AND RESULTS: During 2023, out of a total number of 1,274 samples from broilers in Iran, 114 isolates of Salmonella spp. (8.94%) were detected from which 97 isolates were confirmed as Salmonella Enteritidis (SE). Eight virulence genes including invA, sefA, sopE, spvC, hilA, agfA, sivH and lpfA, were detected among SE isolates and it was found that all isolates harbored these genes at the rate of 100% except for spvC, which was present in 96.90% of the SE isolates. In phenotypic evaluation of resistance against 16 antimicrobial agents, high resistance rates were observed against nalidixic acid, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin. While resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin and chloramphenicol was found to be moderate, it was very low to azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, amikacin, gentamicin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. However, all isolates were sensitive to meropenem, ceftazidime and aztreonam. The mean of MAR index values was 0.26 and 72.15% of the isolates were found to be highly resistant. In detection of 14 resistance genes among SE isolates, five genes including blaTEM, tetA, tetB, sul1 and strA/B were found with prevalence rates of 63.92, 36.08, 61.85, 10.30 and 14.43%, respectively. DISCUSSION: The high prevalence rates of MDR in SE, along with the overwhelming presence of major virulence factors raise public health concerns. These data highlight the great potential risks of the presence and transmission of highly pathogenic MDR Salmonella to humans from chicken meat sources, as well as the need for more effective surveillance for antimicrobial use in the poultry industry. Reducing/optimizing the use of antimicrobials, improving poultry management procedures, using probiotics and biosecurity or vaccines are essential to deal with this issue.","[('Salmonella infections', 'DISEASE'), ('SE', 'DISEASE'), ('SE', 'DISEASE'), ('SE', 'DISEASE'), ('nalidixic acid', 'DISEASE'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('streptomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chloramphenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amikacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aztreonam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('SE', 'DISEASE'), ('strA/B', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MDR', 'DISEASE'), ('SE', 'DISEASE')]"

Considering the prevailing conditions, we have developed a series of naphthalimide/indole benzimidazoles with diverse amines and aryl rings to avoid the molecular framework of conventional drug molecules to overcome the cross-resistance issue. Most of the synthesized compounds, especially electron-withdrawing and halide substituents, show broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Preliminary studies indicate that compounds IB-14 and NB-8 display excellent antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, exceeding the performance of the marketed drug amoxicillin. In addition to the rapid bactericidal effect, both compounds significantly inhibit the formation of biofilm, lowering the development of drug resistance. Moreover, both compounds exhibit fast-bactericidal properties, thus shortening the time of treatment and also resisting the emergence of drug resistance up to 20 passages. Further, biofunctional evaluation reveals that both compounds effectively disrupt the membrane, causing the leakage of cytoplasmic contents and loss in metabolic activity. Both compounds efficiently induce the reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the oxidation of GSH to GSSG, decreasing the GSH activity of the cell, and causing oxidative damage to cells. DNA studies show that compounds significantly bind to DNA and form DNA-IB-14/NB-8 complexes that inhibit the replication of DNA and protein. The significant binding affinity of compounds with HSA suggests easy transport of the developed antibacterial candidates to the target site through the carrier protein.

40035547,2025,"Amoxicillin plus gentamicin is the recommended first-line empiric therapy for neonates with infection. Guidelines vary widely in dose (mg/kg), dose frequency, and adjustments according to post-menstrual age (PMA) and post-natal age (PNA). We aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for amoxicillin in neonates with clinical evidence of sepsis and design optimal dosing regimens. One hundred seventy-seven neonates receiving intravenous amoxicillin for infection were enrolled in a prospective, observational PK study in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The probability of PK-pharmacodynamic target attainment (PK-PD PTA) was determined based on minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and the proportion of time concentrations that remained above these values (%T > MIC). Neonates with concentrations > 140 mg/L were considered to be at increased risk of amoxicillin neurotoxicity. A population PK model was developed. Simulations tested existing guidelines and proposed simplified regimens. The median PMA and PNA were 38 (37-40) weeks and 0 (0-2) days, respectively. From simulations, existing regimens with 50 or 100 mg/kg doses were associated with higher potential neurotoxic concentrations (24.9% and 84.5%, respectively). With the existing 30 mg/kg PNG regimen, neonates receiving twice-daily dosing between 3 and 7 days were systematically underdosed. A proposed 30 mg/kg regimen, with twice-daily dosing for the first 2 days PNA and three times daily from day 3, provides an optimal balance between the probability of PK-PD target attainment while minimizing toxicity. For fixed volume dosing, using 52 mg (0.25 mL of 250 mg in 1.2 mL) for those <3 kg and 104 mg (0.5 mL) for those >/=3 kg is proposed.","[('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sepsis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('PK', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin neurotoxicity', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neurotoxic', 'DISEASE'), ('mg/kg', 'CHEMICAL'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE')]"
40035285,2025,"Chlamydia muridarum (Cm) is a moderately prevalent, gram-negative, intracellular bacterium that affects laboratory mice, causing subclinical to severe disease, depending on the host's immune status. The effectiveness of various antibiotic regimens aimed at eradicating Cm in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent laboratory mice was evaluated. NSG mice were cohoused with Cm-shedding BALB/cJ mice for 14 d to simulate natural exposure. Four groups of 8 infected NSG mice were treated for 7 d with either 0.08% sulfamethoxazole and 0.016% trimethoprim (TMS) in water, 0.0625% doxycycline in feed, 0.124%/0.025% TMS in feed, or 0.12% amoxicillin in feed. A control group was provided standard water and feed. The impact of treatment on gastrointestinal microbiota (GM) was investigated using next-generation shotgun sequencing on the last day of treatment. TMS and amoxicillin had negligible effects on GM, while doxycycline had the largest effect. All antibiotic-treated NSG mice exhibited clinical disease, including dehydration, hunched posture, greater than 20% weight loss, and dyspnea, leading to euthanasia 21 to 40 d posttreatment (32.6 +/- 4.2 d; mean +/- SD). Untreated controls were euthanized 14 to 33 d postexposure (23.75 +/- 5.9 d). All mice were fecal PCR positive for Cm at euthanasia. Histologic evaluation revealed multifocal histiocytic and neutrophilic bronchointerstitial pneumonia and/or bronchiolitis featuring prominent intralesional chlamydial inclusion bodies in all mice. Subsequently, groups of 8 C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, NOD.SCID, and NSG mice infected with Cm were treated with 0.124%/0.025% TMS in feed for 7 (BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J) or 21 d (NSG and NOD.SCID). All immunocompetent and NOD.SCID mice were negative for Cm by PCR 14 d posttreatment, remained clinically normal, and had no evidence of Cm infection at necropsy, and all NSG mice remained Cm positive and were euthanized.

OBJECTIVES: To describe antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacteria associated with hepatobiliary disease in dogs and cats over a 10 year-period. ANIMALS: Three hundred nine dogs and cats. METHODS: Bacterial species and antibiotic susceptibility data from positive bile and liver tissue cultures were reviewed from both a Veterinary Teaching Hospital and a private laboratory. Prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria was assessed, along with its association with previous antibiotic administration. RESULTS: A total of 343 bacterial isolates were included from 310 cultures. Monobacterial cultures were more frequent (91%, 283/310). Gram-negative bacteria were predominant (67%, 227/340), with Escherichia coli (49%, 136/340), Staphylococcus spp. (14%, 47/340), and Enterococcus spp. (10%, 34/340) being the most prevalent isolates. Resistance of gram-negative bacteria were: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (33%, 70/214), aminopenicillins (47%, 96/205), and fluoroquinolones (16%, 67/417); for gram-positive bacteria: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (12%, 5/41), aminopenicillins (16%, 11/67), and fluoroquinolones (17%, 35/111). Resistance was significantly higher for aminopenicillins, first-generation cephalosporins, TMPS, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones during 2010-2014 compared to 2015-2019. MDR isolates comprised 40% (135/430) of all isolates, 30% (41/136) of E. coli, and 68% (23/34) of Enterococcus spp. A significantly higher incidence of MDR bacteria was observed in animals with previous antibiotic treatment (81%, 17/21) compared to those without (30%, 22/75; p < 0.001).

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Case reports and case series were included owing to the paucity of data in the literature on SSLR. We performed a comprehensive search of Embase and MEDLINE. Data extracted included age, comorbidities, medication exposure, time to reaction, symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and treatment modalities. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the data. We used chi(2) test was used to compare categorical variables between adults and children. RESULTS: A total of 44 studies involving 468 patients were included. Antibiotics were more associated with SSLR in children than in adults (P < .01). beta-Lactam antibiotics, particularly amoxicillin (72.1%), were the leading implicated agents. Dermatologic manifestations, primarily maculopapular rashes, were present in 100.0% of cases whereas joint symptoms occurred in 78.7%. Corticosteroids were effective in resolving symptoms in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: Serum sickness-like reaction presents diagnostic challenges owing to overlapping symptoms with other drug reactions. beta-Lactams are the most common implicated agents, particularly in pediatric populations.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study conducted between July 1(st) 2018 and July 31(st) 2023. METHODS: We determined the indication for antibiotics and the frequency of guideline-discordant prescriptions for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), urinary tract infection (UTI), and diarrhea. The chi(2) test was used to assess the impact of treatment guidelines on antibiotics prescribed for these indications. RESULTS: The top indications for antibiotic prescription were skin and skin structure infection (SSSI) (n = 5159; 21.5%), URTI (n = 2760; 11.5%) and UTI (n = 2686; 11.2%). Amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 7964; 33.3%), was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic. A large proportion of antibiotic prescriptions for URTI, diarrhea, UTI, and LRTI were either inappropriate (n = 6695; 86.5%) or unnecessary (n = 5534; 71.5%). Results revealed a statistically significant decline in the proportion of inappropriate antibiotics for UTI (91.3% vs 84.0%; P </= .001) and diarrhea (92.6% vs 87.0%; P = .031) and unnecessary antibiotics for diarrhea (90.2% vs 83.2%; P = .016) with the introduction of treatment guidelines.

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective observational study analysing all anaerobic strains isolated from blood cultures in 44 European Hospital Centres over a 4-y period (2020-2023). Diagnostic approach, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility according to EUCAST v. 15.0 were investigated. RESULTS: Our study included 14,527 anaerobes, most of which were Gram-positive (45%) or Gram-negative (40%) bacilli. MALDI-TOF coupled to mass spectrometry was the most widely used tool for species identification (98%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed in the vast majority of centres, using mostly gradient diffusion strip (77%) and disk diffusion (45%) methods according to EUCAST guidelines. The most prevalent species were Cutibacterium acnes (18.7%), Bacteroides fragilis (16.3%), Clostridium perfringens (5.3%), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (4.2%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (3.5%), and Parvimonas micra (3.4%). C. acnes showed high resistance to benzylpenicillin (18%), clindamycin (39%), and imipenem (19% and 13% by MIC methods and disk diffusion, respectively). B. fragilis showed high resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate (24%), piperacillin/tazobactam (22% and 14% by MIC methods and disk diffusion, respectively), clindamycin (22% by both MIC methods and disk diffusion), meropenem (13%), and metronidazole (10%, only by disk diffusion). A similar resistance pattern was observed in B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, and Parabacteroides distasonis. C. perfringens showed high resistance to clindamycin (69% and 45% by MIC methods and disk diffusion, respectively), while benzylpenicillin and metronidazole maintained over 90% activity. F. nucleatum showed high resistance to benzylpenicillin (11%), while Fusobacterium necrophorum showed alarming rates of resistance to clindamycin (12%), meropenem (16%) and metronidazole (11%).

METHODS: This pilot study included twelve individuals with periodontitis and recent ACS. Six patients were treated with subgingival instrumentation (SI), and six with supragingival ultrasonic scaling (US). Amoxicillin 2 g was administered as premedication in the first visit, followed by AMX-MTZ for one week. The incidence of bacteraemia was evaluated using hemoculture, qPCR, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) before the treatment (t0) and 30 min later (t1) (quadrants 1 and 2), and after one-week, pre-post-treatment samples were taken from the re-maining quadrants (t3 and t4). Proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated in serum at baseline (t0), one week (t1), and six months (t5). RESULTS: Bacteraemia was low in 16.6 %, similar in both treatment groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Desulfobulbus oralis (16.6 %), Filifactor alocis, Eubacterium saphenum, Eubacterium brachy (8.3 %) were identified with qPCR. NGS was only detected in a single patient; at time t0, bacteria were more diverse than at t3 and were associated with the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Interestingly, many clones observed in blood were non-oral. After treatment, all cytokines were reduced significantly in the SI group in the long term (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Periodontal therapy reduced bacteremia: despite the antibiotic regimen, bacteria remained in peripheral blood, which could be associated with antimicrobial resistance.

Phylogenetic analysis of antibiotic-resistant genes with NCBI sequences was performed to check their homology. A total of 384 milk samples were collected and subjected to standard microbiological procedures to isolate S. aureus. The results revealed that 177 milk samples were found positive for subclinical mastitis (SCM) out of which 101 milk samples were found positive for S. aureus. The molecular assay found the prevalence of MRSA, BRSA, ARSA, and TRSA as 48.51 %, 46.53 %, 42.57 %, and 39.60 % by targeting the mecA, blaZ, accA-aphD, and tetK genes respectively. The study isolates significant similarities to each other and to previously reported sequences from other countries that were found by in-silico analysis, indicating the possibility of pathogen transboundary transmission. This study also revealed potential risk factors that aid in the spread of mastitis in camels. Among various risk factors, the most significant were farm hygiene, physiological status of animals, type of mastitis, teat injury, use of teat dips, and milk leakage (p < 0.05). The antibiogram of antibiotic-resistant isolates of S. aureus revealed that the highest resistance was observed against penicillin followed by amoxicillin and oxytetracycline while levofloxacin was the most sensitive drug. This study highlights the high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant S. aureus in camel mastitis.

40020440,2025,"Tuberculosis (TB) is historically the world's deadliest infectious disease. New TB drugs that can avoid pre-existing resistance are desperately needed. The beta-lactams are the oldest and most widely used class of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections but, for a variety of reasons, they were largely ignored until recently as a potential treatment option for TB. Recently, a growing body of evidence indicates that later-generation carbapenems in the presence of beta-lactamase inhibitors could play a role in TB treatment. However, most of these drugs can only be administered intravenously in the clinic. We performed a screening of beta-lactams against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and identified sanfetrinem cilexetil as a promising oral beta-lactam candidate. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that: (i) media composition impacts the activity of sanfetrinem against Mtb, being more potent in the presence of physiologically relevant cholesterol as the only carbon source, compared to the standard broth media; (ii) sanfetrinem shows broad spectrum activity against Mtb clinical isolates, including MDR/XDR strains; (iii) sanfetrinem is rapidly bactericidal in vitro against Mtb despite being poorly stable in the assay media; (iv) there are strong in vitro synergistic interactions with amoxicillin, ethambutol, rifampicin and rifapentine and, (v) sanfetrinem cilexetil is active in an in vivo model of infection. These data, together with robust pre-clinical and clinical studies of broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotics carried out in the 1990s by GSK, identified sanfetrinem as having potential for treating TB and catalyzed a repurposing proof-of-concept Phase 2a clinical study (NCT05388448) in South Africa.","[('Tuberculosis', 'DISEASE'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('deadliest infectious disease', 'DISEASE'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sanfetrinem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cholesterol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbon', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sanfetrinem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sanfetrinem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ethambutol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifapentine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('carbapenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sanfetrinem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('NCT05388448', 'DISEASE')]"

A total of 450 fish averaging 12.1 +/- 0.09 g (mean +/- SD) were fed one of the six experimental diet groups in triplicates for 8 weeks. In disease resistance test, 45 fish from each group were intraperitoneally injected with the pathogenic bacteria, Edwardsiella tarda, and mortality was recorded for 15 days. At the end of 8-week feeding trial, weight gain, specific growth rate and feed efficiency of fish fed the Pro-A diet were significantly greater than those of fish fed the CON, OTC and AMO diets (p < 0.05). Furthermore, feeding efficiency and protein efficiency ratio of fish fed the Pro-A diet were significantly greater than those of fish fed the CON, OTC and AMO diets. Serum aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly greater in fish fed the Pro-B diet than in those fed the Pro-A diet. The lysozyme activity of fish fed the Pro-A, Pro-B and Pro-C diets was significantly greater than that of the CON, OTC and AMO diets. The myeloperoxidase activity of fish fed the Pro-A diet was significantly greater than that of the fish fed the CON and AMO diets. The flounder growth hormone levels of fish fed the Pro-A, Pro-B, Pro-C and AMO diets were significantly greater than that of the fish fed the CON diet. The interleukin 1beta gene expression levels in fish fed the Pro-B and Pro-C diets were significantly greater than those in fish fed the CON, OTC and AMO diets. The interleukin 10 gene expression levels in fish fed the Pro-A, Pro-B, Pro-C and OTC diets were significantly greater than those of fish fed the CON and AMO diets. Intestinal histology revealed that the average villi length of fish fed the Pro-A, Pro-B, and Pro-C diets were significantly greater than that of fish fed the CON, OTC and AMO diets. The cumulative survival rates of fish fed the Pro-A, Pro-B and Pro-C diets were significantly greater than those of fish fed the CON diet after the 15th day of the challenge test. Overall, the results demonstrated that the supplementation of fish-derived bacteria, B. subtilis (1 x 10(8) CFU/g diet) or E. faecium (1 x 10(7) CFU/g diet) in the diet could be the ideal probiotics to replace antibiotics in olive flounder fed FM reduced diet.","[('Bacillus subtilis', 'DISEASE'), ('faecium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMO', 'DISEASE'), ('oxytetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tarda', 'DISEASE'), ('weight gain', 'DISEASE'), ('aspartate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('faecium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('FM', 'DISEASE')]"
40014784,2025,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative pneumonia (POP) remains a leading cause of mortality following lung surgery. Recent studies have confirmed that the respiratory tract below the vocal cords is not sterile and often harbours potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPMs), putting patients with lung malignancies at an increased risk for pulmonary infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study analysed 149 patients who underwent bronchoscopy for lung lesions suspected to be lung cancer. Protected specimen brush (PSB) samples were obtained during bronchoscopy prior to any specific treatment. Bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were conducted on the isolated strains. RESULTS: Bacterial colonization was detected in 88.6% of patients, with 21.5% carrying PPMs. Notably, patients with type 2 diabetes exhibited a higher rate of PPM colonization compared to others. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed no significant differences in efficacy between amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and first-generation cephalosporin in both colonized patients and those with PPMs. Importantly, no multidrug-resistant bacteria were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a slightly lower PPM colonization rate compared to previous studies, possibly due to the unique geographic characteristics of the study population. The absence of significant differences in bacterial susceptibility between the two tested antibiotics highlights the need for further research to refine perioperative infection management strategies.","[('Postoperative pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('lung malignancies', 'DISEASE'), ('pulmonary infections', 'DISEASE'), ('lung cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetes', 'DISEASE'), ('PPM', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('PPM', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE')]"
40013520,2025,"BackgroundThe relationship between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients treated with rituximab and nocardiosis remains unclear.Cases ReportA 55-year-old female with lupus nephritis II and smoking history, was treated with high-dose steroids, immunoglobulins, rituximab, and azathioprine. She developed infectious loci in the lungs, hip, and brain. N. farcinica was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage and abscess culture. She was treated with linezolid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), minocycline, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, achieving complete cure at 12 months. The second patient, a 73-year-old male with lupus nephritis V, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and alveolar hemorrhage, was treated with high-dose steroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate, and rituximab. He developed infections in the lungs, prostate, and possibly colon. N. farcinica was detected in blood cultures. Despite treatment with imipenem, linezolid, TMP/SMX, and moxifloxacin, he died from bronchoaspiration.MethodsA systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. The search terms were (systemic lupus erythematosus OR SLE) AND (rituximab) AND (nocardia), with a timeframe up to 15 March 2024. Inclusion criteria were confirmed cases of Nocardia infection in SLE patients treated with rituximab in the previous year. Non-original studies and secondary research were excluded.ResultsOnly one article was included, describing a 34-year-old male with APS and lupus nephritis IV, treated with high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. He had infections in the lungs and brain, with N. farcinica detected in blood cultures. Despite treatment with TMP/SMX and fluoroquinolones, he died from thrombotic complications.ConclusionNocardiosis is more likely in SLE patients due to T lymphocyte immune dysfunction caused by the disease itself, rituximab, and other immunosuppressants. Diagnosis requires a high level of clinical suspicion, supported by long-time blood cultures and 16S rRNA. Beta-lactams and quinolones are reasonable alternatives to TMP/SMX and linezolid, which can worsen the hematological situation, and amikacin, which may worsen lupus nephritis.","[('systemic lupus erythematosus', 'DISEASE'), ('nocardiosis', 'DISEASE'), ('lupus nephritis II', 'DISEASE'), ('steroids', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azathioprine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('linezolid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TMP/SMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('minocycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('lupus nephritis V, autoimmune thrombocytopenia', 'DISEASE'), ('antiphospholipid syndrome', 'DISEASE'), ('APS', 'DISEASE'), ('alveolar hemorrhage', 'DISEASE'), ('steroids', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azathioprine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('mycophenolate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('prostate', 'DISEASE'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('linezolid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TMP/SMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('moxifloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('systemic lupus erythematosus', 'DISEASE'), ('Nocardia infection', 'DISEASE'), ('SLE', 'DISEASE'), ('APS', 'DISEASE'), ('lupus nephritis', 'DISEASE'), ('steroids', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cyclophosphamide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('TMP/SMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('thrombotic', 'DISEASE'), ('SLE', 'DISEASE'), ('immunosuppressants', 'CHEMICAL'), ('quinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TMP/SMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('linezolid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amikacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('lupus nephritis', 'DISEASE')]"

This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the occurrence of S. aureus and E. coli in goats with RTI, analyze the antimicrobial resistance patterns, and explore potential risk factors contributing to RTI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 nasal swab samples were collected from goats, and standard classical bacteriological methods were performed to isolate and identify S. aureus and E. coli. Subsequently, the disc diffusion method was employed to evaluate the antimicrobial sensitivity test. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors associated with RTI. RESULTS: About 13.3% (N = 16; N = 120) isolates were confirmed as S. aureus, and 6.67% (N = 8; N = 120) isolates were confirmed as E. coli. All S. aureus isolates were resistant to ampicillin, and all E. coli isolates were resistant to amoxicillin and penicillin. Among the isolated organisms, 43.7% (N = 7; N = 16) S. aureus and 62.5% (N = 5; N = 8) E. coli isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant (resistant to >/=3 classes of antimicrobials). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female goats [(odds ratio) OR: 4.2; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.8-20.8; p = 0.074] and goats in poor health condition (OR: 3.8; 95% CI: 0.7-19.3; p = 0.100) were more prone to RTI caused by S. aureus.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between TMP-SMX and the risk of ARF/ARDS using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). METHODS: We analyzed adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in FAERS from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2023. We focused on reports where TMP-SMX, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or azithromycin were the primary suspect drugs for ADEs in individuals aged 10 to 24 years. The outcomes of interest-ARF/ARDS-were identified using MedDRA-preferred terms. We used an active comparator-restricted disproportionality analysis (ACR-DA) to estimate the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusting for age, sex, acne, and urinary tract infections. Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Networks (BCPNN) were used to calculate the Information Components (IC(025)). Due to the amount of missing information, a case-by-case analysis could not be performed. RESULTS: 3171 ICSRs (810 for TMP-SMX, 1617 for azithromycin, and 744 for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) were included in the study. ACR-DA showed an unadjusted 8-fold increase in the reports of ARF/ARDS with TMP-SMX compared with azithromycin (unadjusted ROR, 7.98; 95% CI, 4.09 to 15.60) and an adjusted 3-fold increase after adjustment for age, sex, acne, and urinary tract infection (adjusted ROR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.28 to 6.11). BCPNN analysis confirmed significant disproportionality (IC(025), 0.75). No cases of ARF/ARDS were reported for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: TMP-SMX may increase the risk of ARF/ARDS, requiring further validation in larger pharmacoepidemiological studies. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research to further investigate the safety profile of TMP-SMX in adolescent populations.

Its antibiotic resistance and susceptibility patterns are crucial for effective treatment. This study aims to assess the prevalence of E. coli in clinical samples and evaluate its antibiotic resistance patterns at SRM Medical Hospital and Research Center from 2022 to 2023. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using microbiological records from 30,838 clinical samples collected over two years. Positive E. coli isolates were identified and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Demographic data, including age and sex, were analysed. Resistance patterns were assessed using the Vitek 2 system and disc diffusion methods as per CLSI guidelines. RESULTS: Out of 30,838 samples, 8694 yielded positive cultures, with 2597 E. coli isolates. Most isolates (69.6 %) were from urine, followed by exudate (20.4 %) and blood (6.8 %). E. coli infection was more prevalent in females (60.92 %) and individuals aged 41-70 years (48.97 %) (p < 0.001). High resistance was observed for amoxicillin-clavulanate (32 %) and ciprofloxacin (17.98 %), with high susceptibility to colistin (90.98 %) and piperacillin-tazobactam (90 %). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the prevalence of E. coli, especially in urine samples and among females and older adults. High resistance to commonly used antibiotics emphasizes the need for regular susceptibility testing and antimicrobial stewardship.

This study investigated amoxicillin-induced bacterial gut dysbiosis and its impact on the immune response of C57BL/6 mice to pulmonary infection by Mycobacterium bovis-BCG. It was observed that amoxicillin treatment resulted in bacterial gut dysbiosis, characterized by an increase in the phylum Proteobacteria and a reduction in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. This alteration was associated with a decrease in the animals' body weight and a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and IL-6, suggesting a compromised immune response. Additionally, microstructural analysis revealed significant alterations in the caecum and pulmonary structure of the mice, indicating tissue damage associated with intestinal dysbiosis. The results indicate that amoxicillin-induced bacterial gut dysbiosis may negatively affect pulmonary immunity and exacerbate M. bovis-BCG infection, highlighting the need to consider the impacts of intestinal microbiota on the development and control of tuberculosis.

In this study, the antibiotic resistance phenotypes and genotypes of 56 endophytic bacteria isolates from three species of wild edible fungi in Yunnan were analyzed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and PCR amplification. The results revealed that all isolates were sensitive to ofloxacin, but resistance was observed against 17 other antibiotics. Specifically, 55, 53, and 51 isolates exhibited resistance to amoxicillin, penicillin, and vancomycin, respectively. Antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) detection indicated that the sulfonamide sul1 gene had the highest detection rate (53.57%). Excluding the ARG that was not detected, the lowest detection rates were the sulfonamide sul2 and sul3 genes, both at 1.79%. Among six tetracycline resistance genes, only tetK and tetM were detected. For beta-lactam antibiotics, blaTEM, blaVIM, and blaSHV genes were present, while blaOXA was absent. In aminoglycoside resistance genes, aadB was not detected, while detection rates for aac(3')-IIa, acrB, and aadA1 were 3.57%, 1.79%, and 37.5%, respectively. The chloramphenicol Cat gene was detected at a rate of 14.29%, whereas floR was absent. For polypeptide resistance, VanC was detected at 3.57%, with EmgrB not detected.

The aim of the study was to point out the importance of stratified cumulative antibiograms at the level of individual health care facilities and the significant differences between epidemiological data, not only at the national level, but also at the local level. Our study analyses data from 383 patients with UTIs from a hospital department, General University Hospital (GUH), and 272 patients from an outpatient medical facility, Urocentrum (UC). This analysis focuses on the most common UTI causative agent, Escherichia coli, its representation as the causative agent of UTI in patients with complicated acute cystitis (N30), and its representation in complicated acute cystitis in patients with prostate cancer (C61). In addition to the frequency of occurrence, a sub-analysis of the incidence of resistance of E. coli to commonly used antibiotics by age, gender, diagnosis, and medical facility was performed. Results: The most common causative agent of UTI was E. coli. In patients with N30, it was 70% in GUH and 54% in UC, but in oncological patients with UTI, it was only 39% and 35%, respectively.

40001451,2025,"Background/Objectives: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global problem with antibiotic consumption considered a key modifiable factor for the development of AMR. Long-term care (LTC) facilities have been identified as potential reservoirs for Escherichia coli (E. coli) resistance due to high rates of urinary tract infection (UTI) and high levels of antibiotic consumption among residents. However, while the relationship between these two factors is well accepted, little is known about the possible temporal relationship between these. This study explores trends in E. coli resistance and antibiotic consumption in LTC focused on potential temporal relationships between antibiotic utilization and AMR. METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal, and ecological analysis was conducted between 31 May 2016 and 31 December 2018. The primary outcomes were the monthly prevalence of E. coli AMR in urine isolates and the monthly percentage of residents using an antibiotic recommended for the management of UTI in national treatment guidelines (amoxicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, cefalexin, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim). RESULTS: During the study period, 10,835 urine E. coli isolates were tested, and 3219 residents received one or more medicines and were included in the medicines dataset. Over one-quarter were resistant to at least one of the target antibiotics (23.3%). For most antibiotics, the temporal relationship between AMR and antibiotic utilization was unclear; however, potential patterns were observed for both trimethoprim and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid. Trimethoprim showed a temporal decrease in both AMR and utilization, while amoxicillin with clavulanic acid showed a lag time of approximately four months between utilization and resistance.

Methods: Eighteen healthy adult patients requiring impacted mandibular third molar extraction were randomly assigned to two groups: an experimental group (EG) receiving 2 g of amoxicillin and a placebo group (PG) receiving empty capsules, one hour before the surgery and before taking the first saliva sample. Primary outcomes measured were pain levels at different time points and salivary PGE2 concentrations measured before, 24 h, and 7 days after the surgery, while secondary outcomes included changes in maximum mouth opening (MMO) immediately after the surgery at 1 day and a week post-surgery, and facial swelling at 24 h and 7 days post-surgery. Results: The results showed no significant differences between the EG and PG in terms of pain levels, salivary PGE2 concentration, MMO changes, or facial swelling at different time points (p-values > 0.05). One instance of surgical site infection was noted in the PG in the 7-day follow-up session, but it was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.303). Correlation analyses indicated that a higher number of sutures and a higher difficulty index of surgery were associated with increased pain, while longer surgery duration and osteotomy were linked to more MMO changes and facial swelling (p-values < 0.05). In addition, while longer surgery duration and performing tooth section were correlated with lower PGE2 concentrations, PGE2 concentrations were positively correlated with pain levels (p-values < 0.05).

40001419,2025,"Background: The global spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) necessitates collaborative approaches between animals, their environment, and public health sectors, fostering the One Health concept. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a zoonotic, facultative pathogenic bacterium. Its public health significance underlines the need for the regular monitoring of different strains causing clinical disease, especially in poultry, more specifically in chickens, which have become a critical source of animal protein. Methods: The antimicrobial susceptibility of 133 E. coli strains isolated from clinical cases in large-scale Hungarian poultry between 2022 and 2023 was assessed via the gold-standard minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination, which provides internationally comparable results. Results: Our findings revealed high resistance levels to widely used antibiotics, including amoxicillin (57.9%), neomycin (78.9%), doxycycline (46.6%), and potentiated sulfonamides (43.6%). Resistance to these critically important antibiotics is particularly concerning due to their public health significance. Comparison with regional human resistance data revealed similar patterns for beta-lactam antibiotics; however, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and potentiated sulfonamides exhibited significantly higher resistance levels in veterinary isolates. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of routine surveillance, which has both veterinary and public health implications. Future efforts to correlate antibiotic usage with resistance patterns and to elucidate the genetic background of multidrug-resistant strains will further strengthen the One Health approach.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfonamides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycosides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfonamides', 'CHEMICAL')]"
40001415,2025,"Background/Objectives: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading respiratory pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations. Understanding its antimicrobial resistance patterns and serotype distribution is crucial for guiding treatment and prevention strategies. This study aims to examine these trends in S. pneumoniae isolates from Tunisia over a two-decade period (2000-2019). Methods: A retrospective time series analysis was conducted on data (n = 4284) gathered from eight university hospital centers across Tunisia. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. Pneumococcal serotypes were determined for a subset of samples from 2012 to 2019 (n = 903) using multiplex PCR and latex agglutination. Results: Penicillin G resistance decreased from 9-13.7% during 2000-2002 to 4.3% by 2019, while amoxicillin resistance increased until reaching 10% in 2019. Erythromycin resistance initially increased before stabilizing between 61.9% and 66.3% during 2014-2019, whereas tetracycline resistance declined from 2000 to 2008 and fluctuated around 40% during 2009-2019. Levofloxacin resistance did not exceed 1.2% throughout the study period. The most prevalent serotypes were 14, 19F, 19A, 23F, 3, 6B, 6A, and 9V. Among them, serotype 3 was the most susceptible overall. Serotypes 23F, 14, 9V, and 6B displayed the highest levels of multi-drug resistance. Conclusions: Penicillin G (high-dosage), cefotaxime, and levofloxacin are still effective against most S. pneumoniae strains in Tunisia, while erythromycin and tetracycline are not reliable options for treating pneumococcal infections. Alarming resistance rates among prevalent serotypes, except serotype 3, underscore the need for preventive measures, rational antibiotic use, and ongoing surveillance.","[('pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('19A', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumococcal infections', 'DISEASE')]"

FDC is now a last-line antibiotic for severe infections due to CRKP. METHODS: Susceptibility to a wide range of antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion and broth microdilution method. Carbapenemases were screened by a modified Hodge test while carbapenem hydrolysis was investigated using mCIM and eCIM tests. The screening for beta-lactamase and fluoroquinolone cluster resistance genes was carried out by PCR. Plasmids were characterized by PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). An inter-array genotyping CarbaResist test and whole genome sequencing (WGS) were applied on selected isolates. RESULTS: All of the 31 isolates studied exhibited high-level resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefuroxime, expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC), cefepime, ceftolozan-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin and the majority to gentamicin, and amikacin. Colistin and ceftazidime-avibactam preserved activity against 71% and 87% of the isolates, respectively. The combined disk method with clavulanic acid was positive in all but one isolate, indicating the production of an ESBL. Twenty-eight isolates carried one single carbapenemase-encoding gene, whereas three harbored double bla(CARB) genes. Among the studied isolates, 61% carried bla(OXA-48), 29% bla(KPC) and 12.9% bla(NDM) genes. The inter-array genotyping CarbaResist test and WGS identified additional aminoglycoside-, sulphonamide- and trimethoprim-resistance genes.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, adverse reactions, and compliance of the 14-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy versus drug sensitivity-based individualized therapy in the retreatment of H. pylori infection. METHODS: This multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled non-inferiority study enrolled 240 adult patients who previously failed anti-H. pylori treatment. These patients were randomly assigned to receive the 14-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy or drug sensitivity-based individualized therapy. The primary outcome was the eradication rate, and the secondary outcomes mainly included adverse events, patient compliance, antibiotic resistance rates, and risk factors that affected the eradication rate. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses revealed that the eradication rates for the vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy and drug sensitivity-based individualized therapy were comparably high, with rates of 87.50% and 83.33%, respectively. Furthermore, the vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy fulfilled the criteria for the non-inferiority test, when compared to individualized therapy. The incidence of adverse reactions was significantly lower in the vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy group. Both groups showed similarly good compliance and comparable rates of antibiotic resistance. The previous treatment with a clarithromycin-containing regimen was identified as an independent risk factor for clarithromycin resistance. CONCLUSION: The 14-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy exhibits high eradication rates and low incidence of adverse reactions in retreated patients, indicating its effectiveness and safety as a rescue regimen for patients with H. pylori infection.","[('Helicobacter pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('H. pylori infection', 'DISEASE')]"

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of ESBL-producing E. coli among clinical isolates in China. METHODS: Phenotypic ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were collected from in-patients at a non-tertiary hospital in Suzhou from 2018.06.01 -2019.11.30. All isolates were identified and analyzed by conventional microbiological methods, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined. Genes associated with resistance to beta-lactamases, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, sequence types (STs), and genetic relationship were characterized through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. RESULTS: Eighty-six isolates were collected and sequenced, and genomic analysis identified twenty-five different sequence types (STs). The most prevalent STs were ST131 (n=22, 25.6%), ST1193 (n=16, 18.6%), ST38 (n=9, 10.5%) and ST167 (n=6, 7.0%). blaCTX-M genotypes were the most dominant, comprising a variety of subtypes (eg, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-27, blaCTX-M-55) and blaTEM-type among ESBL-producing E. coli in our study. All cases of co-carriage of beta-lactamase genes showed a strong link to amoxicillin/sulbactam resistance, while the co-carriage of blaCTX-M-15/TEM-1B or blaCTX-M-15/OXA-1 were strongly linked to resistance against cefepime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. In addition, genes associated with resistance to fluoroquinolone, aminoglycosides, and sulfonamides were also detected. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlighted the prevalence of globally circulating ESBL-producing E. coli clones, such as ST131 and ST1193, in Suzhou, China. These clones and sublineages are also resistant to quinolones. No predominant blaCTX-M subtypes were detected, while the coexistence of different ESBL types was strongly linked to resistance to amoxicillin/sulbactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam, suggesting the widespread circulation of diverse blaCTX-M genes within the Suzhou community.

AIM: To assess the H. pylori eradication rate of standard triple therapy and factors affecting the eradication rate. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter follow-up study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at selected healthcare facilities among dyspeptic patients with positive stool H. pylori antigen tests from June 1, 2023 to October 30, 2023 to assess the H. pylori eradication rate. After completing the standard triple therapy, the eradication was confirmed using a stool antigen test 4 weeks later. The data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression methods. RESULTS: The H. pylori eradication rate was 85.4%. Patients with a previous diagnosis of H. pylori infection, smokers, and local alcohol consumption were associated with a lower H. pylori eradication rate, with adjusted odds ratio (AORs) of 0.159 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.050-0.511], 0.206 (95%CI: 0.052-0.822), and 0.228 (95%CI: 0.052-0.997), respectively. Patients with complete symptom resolution were 5.383 times more likely to achieve eradication than patients without symptom improvement, AOR = 5.383, 95%CI: 1.74-21.089.

Poultry is considered a major reservoir for the transmission of Campylobacter to humans. While extensive research has been conducted abroad on the occurrence and epidemiology of C. jejuni in laying hens, there are scant reports on its prevalence in layer chickens in China. The present study was designed to isolate C. jejuni from 482 cloacal swabs collected from seven laying hen farms located in Hubei Province between January and March 2024. Furthermore, the study aimed to explore the genetic diversity, antibiotic resistance, and virulence gene profiles of the isolated strains. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of C. jejuni amounted to 4.36% (21/482). Whole-genome sequencing of these 21 isolates revealed 11 distinct sequence types (STs) and eight clonal complexes (CCs), with ST-6522 and CC-443 emerging as the predominant genotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing against 11 antibiotics revealed high resistance rates among C. jejuni isolates, particularly towards ceftriaxone and enrofloxacin, where resistance was universal (100%). Similarly, high resistance levels were also observed for doxycycline (95.24%), ceftiofur (80.95%), tilmicosin (76.19%), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (57.14%). Through genomic resistance gene prediction, a total of eighteen resistance genes were identified within the 21 C. jejuni isolates. The most frequently occurring resistance genes were the gyrA (T86I) point mutation (95.14%), cmeR (95.14%), and tet(O) (95.14%). Notably, a robust correlation was discernibled between enrofloxacin resistance and the gyrA (T86I) point mutation, as well as between resistance to ceftriaxone and tilmicosin and the presence of the cmeR gene. Conversely, the correlations between other antibiotic resistance phenotypes and their corresponding resistance genes were less robust. A comprehensive analysis of virulence genes isolated from C. jejuni strains revealed a total of 117 virulence genes, categorized according to their functional roles. These categories encompass adhesion (cadF, jlpA, porA, pebA), invasion (ciaB), motility (flaA, flgB, flhB), toxin production (cdtA, cdtB, cdtC), and immune modulation (htrB, wlaN).

Direct oral penicillin challenge has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective method for the removal of PALs. However, the question of whether a single dose is sufficient to ascertain true allergy status remains unanswered, with some studies suggesting that extended challenges of 3 or more days are superior for the exclusion of delayed immune reactions. The aim of the PROSPECTOR studies was to determine the feasibility (PROSPECTOR-1) of a definitive trial (PROSPECTOR-2) to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of prolonged oral challenge (ie, 5 days) versus single-dose oral challenge in patients with a delayed or unknown penicillin allergy phenotype (PROSPECTOR-2). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A pair of double-blind two-arm parallel placebo-controlled trials will be undertaken-PROlonged versus Single dose in PEnicillin oral Challenge Testing double-blind parallel group randomised placebo-cOntrolled tRial (PROSPECTOR Studies). Patients with a reported delayed or unknown timing penicillin allergy who have passed a supervised single-dose oral amoxicillin challenge (with or without prior skin testing/single or split dose) will be recruited. Informed patient consent will be granted for sites to recruit patients and collect routine clinical data. PROSPECTOR-1 will assess the safety and feasibility of a placebo-controlled trial for single-dose amoxicillin challenge versus 5-day prolonged oral challenge. PROSPECTOR-2 will assess the superiority of the 5-day prolonged oral challenge compared with single-dose amoxicillin challenge in excluding a delayed immune reaction.

39980324,2025,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is humans' second most common bacterial infection. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a common practice in underdeveloped and many developing countries that often leads to the emergence of resistant microorganisms to one or several of these agents with gradual narrowing of scope for effective molecules to combat bacterial infections including UTIs. As a common practice, empirical antimicrobial treatment is initiated before the laboratory results of urine culture are available which may lead to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant strains. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the common bacterial uropathogens associated with urinary tract infection and their susceptibility to antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to analyze the prevalence of culture-positive isolates and determine the susceptibility patterns of bacterial uropathogens to antibiotics at GAMBY Teaching General Hospital, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.

Of the total urine samples collected, 974 (56.8%) were from women and 456 (26.6%) revealed a positive culture. Among the positive isolates, the gram-negative was 340 (74.6 %), which makes it the most prevalent type. E. coli, 276 (60.5%) and S. saprophyticus, 78 (17.1%) were the two most prevalent uropathogens isolated. The highest percentage of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was seen with nitrofurantoin 338 (91.4%), Clindamycin 72 (83.7%), Norfloxacin 244 (79.2%), and Cefoxitin 22 (78.6%). Ampicillin 48 (100%), Piperacillin 6(100%), Cefixime 6 (100%), Clarithromycin 6 (100%), Amoxicillin 96 (96%), Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 242 (89.6%), and Penicillin 12 (85.7%) had the highest percentage of resistance among all isolates to the antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Urinary tract infections are mostly caused by Gram-negative bacteria predominantly in females and Escherichia coli is the most common isolated bacteria. Nitrofurantoin, Norfloxacin, cefoxitin, and clindamycin are considered appropriate antimicrobials for the empirical treatment of urinary tract infections. The majority of uropathogens were resistant to antibiotics commonly used in clinical practice. The resistance pattern to all of the microorganisms incriminated showed there was a progressive increment of resistance to the common antibiotics over the study period. Empirical treatment of UTIs should be guided on the newer culture and sensitivity pattern and more importantly, prescriptions should be revised following the culture and sensitivity results.","[('Urinary tract infection', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('uropathogens', 'DISEASE'), ('urinary tract infection', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Cefoxitin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Piperacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Cefixime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('Nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefoxitin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE')]"
39980042,2025,"Acute Otitis Media (AOM) typically affects previously healthy children and can be recurrent. This inter-society consensus aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the antibiotic therapy of mild, severe and recurrent otitis media in previously healthy children in Italy.A systematic literature review was conducted to identify the most recent/relevant evidence. The Embase, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane databases were used with the terms ""children,"" ""acute otitis media"", ""recurrent otitis media"", and ""antibiotics,"" from 2012 to April 2024, with no language restrictions. The review focused on studies conducted in high-income countries involving antibiotic therapy in children over 3 months of age diagnosed with AOM or Recurrent AOM (RAOM). The GRADE ADOLOPMENT was used to assess the possibility of adopting or adapting recommendations from two evidence-based guidelines: 'NICE guideline Otitis media (acute): antimicrobial prescribing', updated to 2022 and SIP Intersocietal GL 2019 ""Management of acute otitis media in paediatric age: diagnosis, therapy and prevention"" The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Final recommendations were formulated through a Delphi consensus process with an expert panel.All major randomised trials and international guidelines promote the appropriate use of antibiotics and advocate a therapy with narrow-spectrum molecules (amoxicillin). The amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is only envisaged when there is a risk of infection by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. In healthy children, amoxicillin should be initiated as a first-line treatment only after a 48-72-h period of appropriate ""watchful waiting"", during which symptoms are treated while monitoring the patient clinically to see if symptoms resolve. Amoxicillin-clavulanate or second-generation cephalosporins should be reserved for non-immunized children, those with immune deficiencies or those with underlying conditions. In these cases, the use of a clavulanic acid-protected amoxicillin is preferred even though there is no specific scientific evidence to support this choice.The recommended amoxicillin dosage is 90 mg/kg/day, divided into three doses, though two doses may be considered to improve compliance. A five-day duration of therapy is advised.In conclusion the diagnosis of AOM/RAOM relies primarily on clinical assessment, which often introduces uncertainty in distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections whereby there remains significant potential to improve antibiotic utilisation. Future studies could play a key role in enhancing the management of AOM/RAOM in children, ensuring that antibiotic treatments are appropriate and effective.","[('AOM', 'DISEASE'), ('otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('AOM', 'DISEASE'), ('AOM', 'DISEASE'), ('RAOM', 'DISEASE'), ('Otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('immune deficiencies', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"
39979852,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has attracted much attention since its discovery. This bacterium has had a substantial impact on society, the economy, and public health. In recent years, with the continuous increase in drug resistance in H. pylori and the emergence of multidrug resistant strains, the existing diagnostic and treatment options are no longer able to meet clinical needs, so we need to understand the dynamically changing nature of drug resistance of H. pylori in our region. This study collected stool samples from community residents in Lianyungang to analyse the local H. pylori infection status, resistance to commonly used antibacterial agents, and risk factors to provide a reference for local clinical empirical treatment. METHODS: Human stool samples from Lianyungang residents were collected, the DNA of H. pylori in the positive samples was extracted, the sites of mutated genes were determined by PCR and nucleic acid mass spectrometry, and genotypes of cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) were tested. The resistance rates of local H. pylori strains to five antibacterial agents, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, furazolidone, amoxicillin, and tetracycline, were collected, and the risk factors for drug resistance were analysed statistically based on questionnaire results. RESULTS: A total of 221 residents with qualified stool samples were enrolled. The infection rate was 25.3%. DNA was extracted from 56 H. pylori samples. Among them, only 17 H. pylori strains were sensitive to all five antibiotics, and a total of five drug resistance patterns were detected. The main drug resistance patterns were single drug resistance to clarithromycin (30.4%) and double drug resistance to levofloxacin + clarithromycin (21.4%). The levofloxacin resistance mutations were mainly located at N87K and D91Y of the gyrA sequence, and the clarithromycin resistance mutations were mainly located at A2143G in the 23S rRNA sequence. Age, gastrointestinal symptoms, and previous history of H. pylori infection were risk factors for resistant H. pylori. A previous history of H. pylori infection was an independent risk factor for the development of drug resistance in H. pylori. CONCLUSION: The H. pylori infection rate in the Lianyungang area is lower than the national rate, but the rates of resistance to levofloxacin and clarithromycin are quite high. Drug sensitivity testing is needed to provide more accurate individualized treatment and improve the eradication rate of H. pylori. Continuous monitoring of local antibiotic resistance patterns remains the first choice for empirical treatment.","[('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('VacA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('furazolidone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('K', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gyrA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gastrointestinal symptoms', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39977467,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Colistin and beta-lactams are widely investigated because of their effectiveness in the treatment of human diseases. This study investigated the phenotypic and genotypic profiles of colistin- and beta-lactam-resistant Escherichia coli (n = 235) obtained from bovines, swine, and workers from a mixed slaughterhouse in Brazil. METHODOLOGY: The disk diffusion method was used to test the resistance against beta-lactams (amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefazolin, cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, meropenem, and aztreonam). In order to test colistin resistance, the isolates were subjected to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) technique using the broth microdilution method (BMD; 0.5 to 16 mug/mL) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting colistin- (mcr-1 to mcr-5) and beta-lactam- (blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, ampC) genes. The pmrAB mutation was further investigated. RESULTS: The isolates presented resistance, especially to ampicillin (cattle: 14/106, swine: 62/100, humans: 10/29) and amoxicillin (cattle: 7/106, swine: 61/100, humans: 8/29). One swine isolate was characterized as extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producer. The isolates obtained from swine presented higher frequencies of colistin resistance (13/100) when compared to isolates from bovines (5/106) and humans (0/29). Molecular assays concluded that the isolates presented blaTEM (swine: 67/100, humans: 7/29), ampC (swine: 1/100), and blaCTXM (swine: 1/100). The pmrAB complex presented mutations (T31S, P42A, I128N, G144S, H2R, N358Y, D283G, K15I).

METHODS: Literature databases were used to retrieve clinical randomized controlled trials of H. Pylori eradication. Network meta-analysis was performed using BUGSnet and meta package of R software, using OR values as effect size, and SUCRA was used to rank the efficacy of interventions under each outcome. RESULTS: A total of 55 studies and 130 arms were included. The NMA analysis found that the top regimen in term of eradication rate outcome was: Rabeprazole +  Bismuth +  Furazolidone + Tetracycline (SUCRA, 97.5). In terms of safety outcomes: Lansoprazole +  Bismuth +  Amoxycillin +  Clarithromycin (SUCRA, 91.97).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic characterization and similarity of MRSA strains isolated from both inpatients and outpatients who visited various healthcare facilities in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A total of 200 MRSA strains were isolated from participants between March 2018 and June 2019. The recovered strains were characterized using both phenotypic and genotypic methods. All isolates (n=200) tested positive for the S. aureus 16S rRNA gene, with 92.5% also testing positive for the mecA gene, while 7.5% were identified as methicillin-susceptible. Furthermore, the typing and subtyping of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) genetic element indicated that 61.6% of the MRSA strains were classified as type III (hospital-acquired), while 32.4% were identified as type IV and 6% remained of an unknown type. Subtyping of SCCmec type IV and the detection of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene were also conducted. The genetic relatedness among MRSA isolates, assessed through Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR), revealed two primary clusters, with no discernible differentiation between outpatient and inpatient strains. Additionally, Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) fingerprinting of the examined strains identified four major clusters. The first cluster comprised three groups (16 strains), isolated from patients with respiratory and soft tissue infections. The second cluster included two groups (12 strains), all recovered from patients with respiratory, soft tissue, and urinary tract infections (UTIs). The third and fourth clusters each contained one group (6 strains and 5 strains, respectively), all isolated from outpatients. In conclusion, Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed significant resistance to ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with vancomycin and gentamicin being the most susceptible. Multiplex PCR identified all positive MRSA strains within hours. Most isolates were SCCmec type III and type IV.

We report our experience with oral antibiotic combination therapy as rescue therapy for children with ASC failing to respond to conventional medical therapy (CMT). METHODS: We analysed data of children admitted with ASC between January 2020 and January 2023 who failed steroids and infliximab and received the oral antibiotic combination therapy (vancomycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole and doxycycline). Treatments and responses including Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), biochemical markers, intestinal ultrasound (IUS) and colectomy rates (acute and deferred) were collated. RESULTS: Oral antibiotic combination therapy was prescribed in 12 episodes of ASC in 11 children following failure of CMT. Improvements were seen in PUCAI (mean difference = -27.86, 95% confidence interval = -43.43 to -12.28, P  < 0.001), albumin (mean: 29.5-33.6) and CRP (mean: 12-4), as well as in IUS (bowel wall thickening, extent of involvement or vascularity in five of seven). Five of 11 children were colectomy free at a maximum follow-up of 24 months. Three children had acute colectomy during index admission and three underwent deferred colectomy at a mean of 4 months.

39974042,2025,"BACKGROUND: Rising prevalence of bedaquiline resistance undermines benefits from this life-saving drug for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB). Despite increasing awareness, patient-level outcomes for bedaquiline-resistant TB have not been well-characterised and case management poorly defined. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with matched controls at a TB referral hospital in South Africa. Cases included patients >/=13 years with a phenotypic bedaquiline-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate identified between January 2018 and June 2023. Matched controls (1:1) with bedaquiline-susceptible RR-TB were selected from a prospective observational study conducted at the same facility. Primary outcomes included time to sputum culture conversion (SCC), a modified WHO-defined unfavourable outcome, and TB-free survival (alive, with SCC, and in care or treatment completed) through 18 months. Adjusted analyses used Cox proportional hazards models. FINDINGS: Eighty-two patients with bedaquiline-resistant TB were included; 57 (70%) were HIV-positive and 17 (21%) had no prior exposure to bedaquiline or clofazimine. Bedaquiline was prescribed for 72 (88%) and meropenem (plus amoxicillin-clavulanate) for 32 (39%) after submission of the sputum sample with the first bedaquiline-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate. At 18 months, 43 (52%) patients achieved TB-free survival; 17 (20%) failed to achieve sustained SCC, there were 19 (23%) deaths, and 50 (80%) survivors (n=63) were still on treatment. WHO treatment outcomes following treatment initiation were unfavourable in 54 (67%) patients, driven by treatment failure in 35 (43%). Median time to SCC after treatment initiation was 175 (IQR 100-254) days in the bedaquiline resistant cohort and 32 days (IQR 30-42 days) in the matched bedaquiline susceptible cohort. Baseline smear microscopy grade (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23-0.73, p=0.003) and bedaquiline resistance (HR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.23, p<0.001) were associated with reduced SCC. INTERPRETATION: Current treatment options for bedaquiline-resistant TB result in prolonged therapy, delayed microbiological responses, and poor clinical outcomes.

39972462,2025,"A significant variable in the genesis of peptic ulcers is Helicobacter pylori, which could be eliminated through several strategies. Amid them, there is a strategy based on receptor histamine-2 (e.g., famotidine) antagonist in conjunction with metronidazole and amoxicillin as antibiotics. This research used UV spectrophotometry paired with chemometrics to clarify the concurrent analysis of famotidine (FAM), amoxicillin (AMX) and metronidazole (MET) in bulk powder and mixed tablet formulations. The first derivative was calculated for determining FAM and MET. Nonetheless, the methods of double divisor ratio spectra and Fourier functions were incorporated for determining each of the three medications. The methods linearity was fine in the strength ranges of 3-20 microg mL(-1) (FAM), 12-40 microg mL(-1) (AMX) and 4 -20 microg mL(-1) (MET), as shown by the correlation coefficient (0.9999). Analyzing the triple therapy of FAM, AMX and MET helped in the determination of the techniques' accuracy and precision which were done for both their synthetic and combined tablet mixture solutions, as well as in their combined tablet mixture solutions in simulated stomach fluid. Adopting UV spectrophotometry was advantageous over HPLC and HPTLC techniques for FAM, AMX and MET simultaneous determination. This can be attributed to better cost and time efficiency, lack of sophistication, less amounts of reagents and wastes and therefore better greenness when talking about UV spectrophotometry. Upon co-formulation of FAM, AMX and MET triple therapy, their routine analysis could benefit from the presented methodologies in quality control labs. Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) as well as White Analytical Chemistry (WAC) were both employed for assessing the UV spectrophotometric methods that were described with an emphasis on the cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness of the suggested techniques.

39970557,2025,"Artificial snowing is a process that allows ski operators adapt to snow scarcity due to climate change while raising environmental and public health concerns about the role it plays in environmental dissemination of pollutants, but studies addressing this question are still scarce. This study aimed to fill this gap in understanding the role of artificial snowmaking in dissemination of antibiotics, bacterial contaminants, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and genetic determinants (ARGs) thereof. Technical snow and water used for its production were examined from 11 ski stations located in four river catchments, varying in anthropopressure and the presence/absence of storage reservoirs where water is collected before snowmaking. Culturable E. coli were found in all water intakes with clear reduction/elimination during snowmaking. Fourteen antimicrobial agents were detected using UHPLC/MS/MS. Concentration and prevalence of antimicrobials differed between the catchments; the sites located downstream of long-term stay health centers were most severely contaminated. Two antibiotics of restricted use (vancomycin and linezolid) were detected downstream of hospitals. Antimicrobial resistance of 158 E. coli strains was tested using disk diffusion method. The resistance to penicillins (e.g. ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) was most frequent and in general followed the pattern of antibiotic consumption rather than antibiotic concentration in water. Extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) genes were detected using PCR tests: 66.46 % (105 out of 158) strains possessed at least one ARG among which blaTEM was most frequent, followed by blaCTX-M and blaSHV. Our study indicates that the major sources of aquatic environment and technical snow contamination with antimicrobial agents are effluents from long-term stay medical centers, while bacterial contamination (including ARB and ARGs) stems from municipal WWTPs, i.e. the main hubs of antimicrobial resistance transfer to the environment.

These genes are thought to play essential roles in beta-lactam resistance-dinB in increasing mutation rates and katE in managing oxidative stress. By comparing the adaptation rates, transcriptomic profiles, and genetic changes of wild-type and knockout strains, we aimed to clarify the contributions of these genes to beta-lactam resistance. While all strains exhibited similar adaptation rates and mutations in the frdD gene and ampC operon, several unique mutations were acquired in the DeltakatE and DeltadinB strains.

Among patients one month to 59 months old, viral pathogens are the most common cause of lower respiratory infections. The study aims to determine the frequency distribution of antibiotic prescription among patients one month to 59 months old and to determine the adherence of primary care facilities to local guidelines with recommended antibiotics. METHODS: A descriptive retrospective study using electronic medical records was conducted at two primary care sites. Patients aged 1 month to 59 months old seeking consult via telemedicine or face-to-face diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia from April 2019-March 2020 in the rural facility and May 2019-April 2020 in the remote facility were included in the study. The primary outcome was to determine the patterns of antibiotic use in pneumonia in remote and rural areas and adherence to the recommended antibiotics by the 2016 Philippine Academy of Pediatric Pulmonologists pediatric community-acquired pneumonia clinical practice guidelines (CPG). RESULTS: There were 30 pediatric patients diagnosed with pneumonia in the rural facility and 213 in the remote facility. Of these patients with pneumonia, 96.7% and 94.8% were prescribed antibiotics in the rural and remote sites, respectively. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the rural facility was co-amoxiclav (26.7%), while amoxicillin (51.6%) was the most common in the remote facility. Adherence to the CPG in the rural site was lower at 23.3% (n=8/30) compared to the remote site which was 55.9% (n=119/213).

Adherence to recommended antibiotics was higher in the remote setting than in the rural setting. Use of EMR to monitor quality of care can improve patient outcomes and safety, pointing out the importance of improving the quality of documentation in the study sites.","[('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('respiratory infections', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('community-acquired pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('co-amoxiclav', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE')]"
39966906,2025,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to analyze the existing literature to determine the most effective and safe duration of antimicrobial treatment in odontogenic infections of the mandible, addressing a critical gap in clinical guidelines regarding optimal treatment duration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024551258), and a comprehensive search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Embase, and Google Scholar for articles published up to June 16, 2024. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating different durations of antimicrobial treatment were prioritized. RESULTS: The database search yielded 3,446 articles. After removing duplicates using Rayyan(c) software, 2,653 articles remained, of which 26 met the inclusion criteria. Following a thorough evaluation, 8 studies were deemed highly relevant and included in the final analysis. The findings suggest that shorter antibiotic regimens, typically ranging from 3 to 5 days, are effective when combined with surgical interventions, minimizing complications and bacterial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence indicates that the choice of antibiotic regimen and its duration should be tailored to the patient's clinical condition, the severity of the infection, and local bacterial resistance patterns. While amoxicillin and its derivatives are effective for most cases, alternative antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or metronidazole may be more suitable in specific scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of individualized treatment plans and the need for further randomized clinical trials to refine evidence-based guidelines.","[('odontogenic infections of the mandible', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39965795,2025,"BACKGROUND: Owing to the high prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in China, bismuth-containing quadruple therapies have been recommended for H. pylori eradication. This study compared the efficacy and safety of quadruple regimens containing vonoprazan vs. esomeprazole for H. pylori eradication in a patient population in China. METHODS: This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. Patients with confirmed H. pylori infection were randomized 1:1 to receive quadruple therapy for 14 days: amoxicillin 1000 mg and clarithromycin 500 mg after meals, bismuth potassium citrate 600 mg before meals, plus either vonoprazan 20 mg or esomeprazole 20 mg before meals, all twice daily. The primary outcome was the eradication rate of H. pylori, evaluated using a 13C urea breath test at 4 weeks after treatment. The non-inferiority margin was at 10%. RESULTS: The study included 510 patients, 506 of whom completed the follow-up assessment. The primary analysis revealed eradication rates of 86.8% (210/242) and 86.7% (208/240) for vonoprazan and esomeprazole therapy, respectively (treatment difference: 0.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.95, 6.17; non-inferiority P = 0.0009). Per-protocol analysis showed eradication rates of 87.4% for vonoprazan and 86.3% for esomeprazole (treatment difference: 1.2%; 95% CI: -5.03, 7.36; non-inferiority P = 0.0004). Vonoprazan and esomeprazole were well tolerated, with similar safety profiles.

39965701,2025,"The water scarcity crisis is currently deepened by the presence of emerging contaminants, such as amoxicillin (AMX), threatening ecosystems and living beings due to their toxicity and bioaccumulation. Due to this, in the present study, superabsorbent hydrogels reinforced with oxidized cellulose nanocrystals (CCNC) were developed, forming semi-interpenetrated networks with poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS). The CCNCs were obtained by acid hydrolysis and subsequent chemical oxidation to introduce carboxylate groups with two different levels (low and high) of 200 mmol kg(-1) (L-CCNC) and 677 mmol kg(-1) (H-CCNC), respectively. The effective oxidation of the crystals was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction, where this reaction did not affect their crystallinity, but reduced their thermal stability. While the obtained hydrogels were characterized chemically, thermally, morphologically and mechanically by FTIR, TGA, scanning electron microscopy, hydration and dynamic compression tests. The incorporation of CCNC to PAMPS increased the thermal stability and modified the surface area of the hydrogels. In addition, the maximum hydration capacity reached 4900 % for PAMPS hydrogels with 10 % H-CCNC, maintaining greater flexibility under compression. Finally, in AMX adsorption studies, parameters such as pH, contact time, initial AMX concentration and amount of adsorbent were evaluated. Achieving a maximum adsorption capacity of 136 mg g(-1) with the possibility of reuse in three consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles. These findings highlight the potential of superabsorbent hydrogels reinforced with CCNC as sustainable materials for environmental applications.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('carboxylate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39965242,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To assess practice patterns regarding antibiotics prophylaxis in otologic surgery in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary care center. SUBJECTS: Members of American Neurotology Society (ANS). INTERVENTION: Nationwide survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of antibiotic prescribing among surgeons performing the following six ear surgical procedures: cochlear implantation, tympanoplasty with a clean ear, tympanoplasty with active drainage, cholesteatoma surgery without evidence of infection, cholesteatoma surgery with evidence of infection, and stapedectomy. RESULTS: Seventy-three surgeons completed the survey (15.21% response rate). Twenty-seven percent had more than 25 years in experience, and 18% had 0 to 5 years of experience. Antibiotic prescribing practices varied by procedure: cochlear implantation (64.4%, median 5 d), tympanoplasty (clean ear: 23.3%, median 5 d; active drainage: 53.4%, median 7 d), cholesteatoma surgery (no infection: 30.1%, median 7 d; with infection: 58.9%, median 7 d), and stapedectomy (34.2%, mean 5 d). Cephalosporins were preferred for noninfected procedures, whereas amoxicillin dominated for active infections.

39964988,2025,"Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is associated with preterm delivery and neonatal complications. PPROM is often complicated by intra-amniotic inflammation and/or microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity with Ureaplasma or Mycoplasma. Various prophylactic antibiotic therapies have been proposed to prolong latency between PPROM and delivery, reduce the risk of clinical chorioamnionitis, and improve neonatal complications. However, information on the potential of azithromycin administration to reduce the microbial load of vaginal Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma remains lacking. This prospective cohort study included singleton pregnancies managed with prophylactic antibiotics for PPROM at less than 36 weeks of gestation. All patients received the standard antibiotic regimen for PPROM, which consisted of a single oral azithromycin and intravenous ampicillin every for 2 days followed by 5 days of oral amoxicillin. Vaginal swabs samples were collected when PPROM was confirmed and after the antibiotic regimen administration. The main outcome measures were to investigate the changes in vaginal Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma, and Lactobacillus spp. due to the antibiotic regimen. In addition, the association between the presence and changes in vaginal Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma, pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal complications were examined. Out of 82 eligible PPROM, 51 had positive vaginal Ureaplasma. Thirty-six patients (52.2%) completed the antibiotic regimen. Among those with positive vaginal Ureaplasma who completed the antibiotic regimen, 75% experienced an increase in vaginal Ureaplasma levels. For those who delivered before completing all antibiotic doses, 40% had increased vaginal Ureaplasma levels. Furthermore, the antibiotic regimen resulted in decreased Lactobacillus spp. in almost all cases. It was suggested that azithromycin and ampicillin may not be effective when targeting Ureaplasma or Mycoplasma. Since this study did not search for resistance genes, it cannot be determined that azithromycin resistance in Ureaplasma or Mycoplasma is responsible for the present results. In addition, vaginal Ureaplasma changes were not found to be associated with neonatal sepsis or bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

39963694,2025,"BACKGROUND: Shigella spp are among the notable causes of global diarrheal disease and death, accounting for 13.2% of deaths in 2016. Antimicrobial resistance complicates shigellosis management. Understanding local disease epidemiology is crucial for developing effective preventive strategies, including vaccine use. METHODS: We investigated antimicrobial resistance, risk factors (socioeconomic, behavioral, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), and clinical characteristics of Shigella diarrhea in Mukuru informal settlement and surrounding villages in Nairobi, Kenya. Patients presenting with diarrhea, fever, or both in treatment centers had stool or rectal swab samples cultured, and bacteria was identified through biochemical and serologic tests. RESULTS: The rate of Shigella isolation among the 4689 individuals presenting with diarrhea was 1.4% across all ages, with a similar isolation rate (1.5%) among children <5 years of age. The majority of the Shigella spp (40 [59.7%]) were Shigella flexneri, and the majority of S flexneri (34 of 40 [85%]) were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; however, all were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefpodoxime. The rate of multidrug resistance was higher in Shigella sonnei (13 [48.1%]) than in S flexneri (3 [7.5%]). Shigella positivity was associated with bloody diarrhea, severe/moderate dehydration, coated tongue, and high fever. Consumption of street food was also associated with Shigella diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Despite low prevalence, shigellosis still poses a significant burden of diarrheal disease, warranting future incidence studies. First-line antibiotics against Shigella remain effective, but intermediate resistance to azithromycin and ciprofloxacin is a concerning trend. Improving household food preparation and handling could potentially reduce Shigella infections.","[('diarrheal disease', 'DISEASE'), ('death', 'DISEASE'), ('deaths', 'DISEASE'), ('shigellosis', 'DISEASE'), ('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('fever', 'DISEASE'), ('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefpodoxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bloody diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('dehydration', 'DISEASE'), ('fever', 'DISEASE'), ('Shigella diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('shigellosis', 'DISEASE'), ('diarrheal disease', 'DISEASE'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"

METHODS: A total of 425 patients with K. pneumoniae infections were included in the study. Data on general clinical characteristics and relevant laboratory indicators were collected. The patients were divided into ESBL-producing and non-ESBL-producing groups based on the presence of ESBLs. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors associated with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to assess the predictive efficacy of SIRI and SII for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and its resistance to antibiotics. RESULTS: SIRI and SII levels in the ESBL-producing group were significantly higher than those in the non-ESBL-producing group. Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratios for SIRI and SII were 1.092 and 1.158, respectively, with 95% confidence intervals of 1.001-1.115 and 1.015-1.204, respectively. The critical values for predicting ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were 1.067 for SIRI and 579.68 for SII, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.725 and 0.723, respectively. The AUC values for predicting resistance of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae to piperacillin (PIP), amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMC), and cefazolin (CZO) were 0.614, 0.657, and 0.648 for SIRI, and 0.675, 0.613, and 0.625 for SII, respectively. CONCLUSION: SIRI and SII are significantly associated with the risk of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and can be used to predict a patient's risk of infection with this organism.

39960246,2025,"The tympanic membrane (TM) forms an impenetrable barrier to medical therapies for middle ear (ME) diseases like otitis media. By screening a phage-displayed peptide library, we have previously discovered rare peptides that mediate the active transport of cargo across the intact membrane of animals and humans. Since the M13 filamentous bacteriophage on which the peptides are expressed are large (nearly 1 microm in length), this offers the possibility of noninvasively delivering drugs, large drug packages, or gene therapy to the ME. To evaluate this possibility, EDC chemistry was employed to covalently attach amoxicillin, or neomycin molecules to phage bearing a trans-TM peptide, as a model for large drug packages. Eight hours after application of antibiotic-phage to the TM of infected rats, ME bacterial titers were substantially reduced compared to untreated animals. As a control, antibiotic was linked to wild-type phage, not bearing any peptide, and application to the TM did not affect ME bacteria. The results support the ability of rare peptides to actively deliver pharmacologically relevant amounts of drugs through the intact TM and into the ME. Moreover, since bacteriophage engineered to express peptides are viral vectors, the trans-TM peptides could also transport other viral vectors into the ME.","[('otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('EDC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neomycin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39959493,2025,"Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is a major cause of bovine mastitis and is notorious for its capacity to resist antibiotics, presenting substantial risks to both livestock and human health. The aim of this research was to assess the prevalence of S. aureus in bovine mastitis cases, as well as to examine their patterns of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes contributing to mastitis in cattle. For this study, 120 milk samples were gathered from clinically mastitis affected cows across three districts in the northern part of Bangladesh. The detection and confirmation of S. aureus involved standard microbiological and biochemical techniques. The antibiotic sensitivity of the strains was evaluated using the disk diffusion method with a variety of antibiotics frequently used in veterinary settings. Furthermore, PCR was utilized to explore the presence of virulence genes linked to the pathogenicity of S. aureus. Findings revealed that out of the sampled cases, 56 strains of S. aureus were isolated, indicating a prevalence rate of 46.66 % in cases of clinical mastitis. The results revealed a diverse range of antibiotic resistance patterns among the isolates, with a notable prevalence of resistance to penicillin (100 %), ampicillin (85 %), amoxicillin (75 %), tetracycline (66 %), chlortetracycline (64 %), azithromycin (57 %), kanamycin (54 %), and gentamicin (50 %). 36 isolates out of 56 (64 %) were multidrug resistant in nature. Furthermore, virulence gene profiling identified the genes responsible for biofilm formation (bap), adhesion, inflammation and tissue damage (seb, pvl), and toxin production (hla and hlb), indicating the potential pathogenicity of the isolates. Notably, 12 isolates (21.42 %) harbored gene linked to methicillin resistance (mecA), raising concerns about the potential transmission of antimicrobial-resistant S. aureus strains from dairy cows to humans through the food chain.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study performed at the Vietnam National Children's Hospital from October 2021 to December 2023 in children </=5 years old diagnosed with acute suppurative otitis media. Clinical features of the children were described. Pathogens of interest were identified by culture or real-time PCR (rtPCR). The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae isolates were determined. RESULTS: In total, 482 children </=5 years old were included, of which 70.8% were </=2 years old and 61% had an history of AOM. The most frequent bacteria isolated were H. influenzae (52.1%, 99.6% of which were NTHi) and S. pneumoniae (41.1%). Most S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to azithromycin, clarithromycin and cefuroxime. Most H. influenzae isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, cefixime, cefuroxime, azithromycin and clarithromycin.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of tetracycline versus amoxicillin in furazolidone-based quadruple therapy [bismuth quadruple therapy with furazolidone and tetracycline (BQFT) vs. bismuth quadruple therapy with furazolidone and amoxicillin (BQFA)] in rescue treatments. METHODS: Patients who received BQFT or BQFA as rescue treatment were enrolled in this study. H. pylori status was determined using the (13)C/(14)C urea breath test or histological examination. Eradication rates, adherence and side effects were carefully recorded. RESULTS: A total of 342 participants were included. BQFT showed significantly higher eradication rates (modified intention-to-treat: 96.2% vs. 76%; per-protocol: 97.1% vs. 77.8%, P < 0.001), suggesting superior efficacy for patients with prior treatment failures.

39950010,2025,"OBJECTIVE: We describe the implementation, outcomes, and challenges of a complex outpatient oral antimicrobial therapy program (COpAT) in Canada to provide a framework for those interested in establishing such a program. SETTING: Outpatient ambulatory clinic led by infectious diseases physicians, serving patients from a tertiary hospital and a small community hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study that evaluated the efficacy, safety, and cost savings of patients enrolled in the program from August 2023 to June 2024. RESULTS: One hundred three patients were included, of which 84.4% achieved successful clinical outcomes. Mean age of the patients was 62 years and 30% had diabetes. The top three sources of infections were bone and joint, intra-abdominal, and skin-and-soft tissue. Mean duration of COpAT was 37 days. Seventy-five percent of patients required only a single agent, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was most commonly used. Twenty-two patients developed an adverse reaction, of which three required a change in therapy and one resolved with antibiotic dose reduction. No C. difficile infections or mortality were reported 30-days post COpAT discharge. Twelve patients were re-admitted to the hospital; 50% of the cases were unrelated to infections. Compared to outpatient intravenous therapy, the total cost savings from COpAT were estimated to be $255,000 Canadian dollars (CAD), which translated to an average cost savings of $2500 CAD per patient per year. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated favorable clinical and safety outcomes with our COpAT program and substantial cost savings using existing infrastructure. COpAT allows efficient use of healthcare resources including decongestion of hospitals.","[('infectious diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetes', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('CAD', 'DISEASE'), ('CAD', 'DISEASE')]"
39950002,2025,"BACKGROUND: Antibiograms monitor antibiotic resistance trends and help guide empiric antibiotic treatment. A statewide pediatric antibiogram can help inform stewardship efforts. METHODS: Annual pediatric antibiograms for the five children's hospitals in Georgia from 2014-2023 were collected. All sites used the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines for antibiogram development. Antibiogram data were combined, and the most common bacteria were included: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae complex and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interhospital differences were compared for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The combined data from 2014 and 2023 were compared to demonstrate antibiotic susceptibility changes over time. RESULTS: Data in 2023 for MSSA and MRSA showed clindamycin susceptibility was 78% and 82%, respectively. S. pneumoniae susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanate was 96%. E. faecalis resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin was rare. For all included gram-negative bacteria, susceptibility remained high to 3(rd) generation cephalosporins (90%-92%) and meropenem (95%-99%). From 2014 to 2023, the rate of MRSA decreased from 49% to 33.5%. S. pneumoniae susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanate and clindamycin significantly increased. For E. coli, there was a significant decrease in susceptibility for cefazolin (90% to 84%), ceftriaxone (95% to 92%), and meropenem (100% to 99%). There were nonsignificant decreases in susceptibility for K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Over the past 10 years, MRSA rates decreased, S. pneumoniae antibiotic susceptibility increased, and gram-negative bacilli susceptibility was stable to slightly decreased.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of implementing a pharmacist-led outpatient penicillin allergy testing program. METHODS: This single-site, retrospective cohort study was conducted from July 2022 through December 2023. The study site consisted of an outpatient clinic within a nonacademic community hospital. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who had their penicillin allergy delabeled. Secondary outcomes included percentage of patients who received appropriate antibiotics following allergy delabeling, incidence and type of immunoglobulin E mediated penicillin reactions, number of patients who were relabeled with a penicillin allergy, number of orthopedic patients with a postoperative surgical site infection, average reimbursement per patient, and average appointment time. RESULTS: A total of 457 outpatients received penicillin allergy testing during the study period. Physician specialties who referred patients were orthopedics, obstetrician-gynecologists, infectious disease, urology, urogynecology, cardiothoracic surgeons, and primary care providers. For the primary outcome, 439 patients (96%) were successfully delabeled. All delabeled patients received appropriate antibiotics following testing. There were 17 patients who developed minor itching with or without a localized rash following the amoxicillin challenge, and one patient had a delayed reaction of rash 12 hours after the amoxicillin that resolved with an antihistamine. One patient had their penicillin allergy relabeled. Of the 192 orthopedic patients, 0 patients had a postoperative surgical site infection.

39947613,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Molecular determinants of beta-lactam resistance are poorly explored for most Nocardia species, such as Nocardia brasiliensis. In this study, we characterised resistance mediated by two beta-lactamases in the reference strain N. brasiliensis HUJEG-1 and extended our analysis to nine N. brasiliensis clinical strains. METHODS: The susceptibility of N. brasiliensis HUJEG-1 was determined by measuring the MIC via microdilution for five beta-lactam antibiotics that were or were not associated with beta-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanate and avibactam, 4 microg/mL). Two putative class A beta-lactamase-encoding genes (bla(BRA-1) and bla(BRS-1)) were identified in the HUJEG-1 genome. The kinetic parameters of purified BRA-1 and BRS-1 were determined by spectrophotometry. Measurement of beta-lactam resistance was then extended to nine clinical strains. These phenotypic data were compared with the genomic diversity of whole genomes (next-generation sequencing). RESULTS: N. brasiliensis HUJEG-1 was resistant to amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime, but susceptible to their combination with clavulanate or avibactam. This strain was resistant to imipenem (with or without inhibitors) and susceptible to meropenem. BRA-1 showed high catalytic efficiencies against penams (penicillin, ampicillin) and cephems (cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cefamandole), but not against penems (imipenem, meropenem), suggesting that imipenem resistance was mediated by another mechanism. The hydrolytic activity of BRS-1 was 100-1000-fold lower than that of BRA-1 for all beta-lactams tested, suggesting that BRS-1 has a minor contribution to beta-lactam resistance. Analysis of the nine clinical strains showed variations in susceptibility to cefotaxime, as well as diversity in genetic backgrounds and BRA-1 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: N. brasiliensis HUJEG-1 resistance to penams and cephems is mainly due to the class A beta-lactamase BRA-1.","[('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('avibactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('avibactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephaloridine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalothin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefamandole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39946938,2025,"Pharmaceuticals represent an emerging class of pollutants raising significant environmental health concerns, with their presence in freshwater systems linked to adverse aquatic ecosystem impacts and acceleration of antibiotic resistance development. This narrative review examines recent (2019-2024) pharmaceutical occurrences in freshwater globally, analyzes contamination pathways, evaluates compound-specific degradability, and assesses treatment technologies. Analysis revealed significant pharmaceutical contamination in freshwater sources across the six major continents, primarily entering through wastewater treatment plant effluents, groundwater recharge processes, and inadequate sanitation infrastructure/septic systems. Stark geographical disparities were observed, with regions lacking centralized treatment infrastructure showing multiple-fold higher concentrations, particularly in Africa and Latin America (exemplified by amoxicillin levels reaching 272,156 ng/L in Lagos, Nigeria). Pharmaceutical profiles reflected local healthcare patterns, with antimalarials and antiretrovirals prevalent in endemic regions. Globally prevalent compounds included caffeine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, and diclofenac. While some compounds like caffeine showed relatively good removal in conventional treatment systems, their high usage rates overwhelmed treatment capacity. Others, particularly carbamazepine, demonstrated high recalcitrance to conventional treatment methods. Advanced oxidation processes and membrane technologies showed high removal efficiencies, while biochar-based systems emerged as promising, cost-effective alternatives using locally available resources. The findings underscore the need for both centralized and decentralized treatment approaches. Point-of-use technologies emerge as crucial immediate interventions for regions with inadequate infrastructure, while advanced technologies show promise for large-scale applications. The review emphasizes that municipalities should conduct systematic screening to identify locally prevalent pharmaceuticals, as treatment requirements vary significantly with local usage patterns, making a one-size-fits-all approach ineffective.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('caffeine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('acetaminophen', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ibuprofen', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbamazepine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diclofenac', 'CHEMICAL'), ('caffeine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbamazepine', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Blood agar and mannitol salt agar were used for S. aureus isolation and identification. Selective media were then used for additional purification. Observations of morphological and biochemical traits verified the existence of S. aureus. Through questionnaire-based surveys, the prevalence of S. aureus mastitis was identified, and risk variables linked to its incidence were evaluated. The findings showed that S. aureus mastitis was prevalent in 42.5% of cases, with sub-clinical cases having a greater incidence (45.8%) than clinical cases (37.5%). Risk factors such as distance from dung pile to stall(m), source of water, dung removal per day, lactation period (weeks), parity, effect of milk yield (L), traumatic injury of udder, housing type, floor type, teat dipping, and bedding type was identified and their relationship to the occurrence of S. aureus mastitis was studied. Tests for antibiotic sensitivity revealed that S. aureus isolates were responsive to gentamycin, ceftiofur, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin but extremely resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin. Additionally, the Somatic Cell Count (SCC) and California Mastitis Test (CMT) were used at different intervals to assess the effectiveness of the medication. Furthermore, compared to other treatment groups, a larger percentage of cure rates was seen in the groups receiving ceftiofur and enrofloxacin.

Bangladesh has adopted the Pocket Book guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO) for hospital management of childhood pneumonia. These guidelines recommend the proper use of injectable antibiotic administration. Objectives: We assessed and compared the prescription drugs for treating childhood pneumonia following WHO guidelines in a secondary and tertiary hospital in Bangladesh. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional comparative study among children under five years who were admitted to a tertiary hospital, Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH), and a secondary-level hospital, Kushtia District Hospital (KDH), with pneumonia between May 2021 and May 2022. A structured questionnaire was administered to the eligible participants. Additionally, we reviewed the hospital records related to the patient's treatment. SPSS (Version 28) was used to conduct statistical analysis. Results: 316 children were enrolled during the study period, of whom 66.4% were collected from DMCH. There were 65.8% and 24.6% of patients who were classified with severe pneumonia and very severe pneumonia, respectively. In DMCH, the severity of pneumonia percentage was 57.6%, while in KDH, the percentage was 82%. A significant difference was found between the two facilities in diagnosing complicated pneumonia, prescribing the appropriate antibiotics, and ensuring oxygen availability. Amoxicillin was prescribed to 83.5% of the participants, and ceftriaxone was used at a high rate (64.5-70.9%). Combining injections of ceftriaxone with oral amoxicillin or other combinations of antibiotics, both facilities used high frequencies of non-antibiotic corticosteroids.

A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2023 to February 2024 in two tertiary hospitals in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. The study included 410 healthcare professionals selected using proportional allocation and convenience sampling. A structured, self-administered questionnaire was used to assess participants' demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding antibiotic use. Knowledge was assessed through scoring, and attitudes were evaluated using a Likert scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 27.0, employing bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with SMA. Knowledge assessment revealed that 58.5% had good knowledge. In terms of job categories, nurses comprised the largest group (48.8%). A majority (60.2%) had 1-5 years of experience. 57.8% of participants exhibited a poor attitude to SMP. Respiratory infections (20.61%) were the most common health condition reported, followed by gastrointestinal infections (15.43%). The most frequently used antibiotics were amoxicillin (35%), augmentin (25%), and azithromycin (25%). Key factors influencing SMA included ease of access to antibiotics (36%), cost-effectiveness (23%), and knowledge/expertise (22%). Time constraints, perceived severity of conditions, and past self-medication experiences were also significant factors. While 83.8% considered self-medication to be safe, 75% recognized the potential adverse effects of medications.

39937630,2025,"The application of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) towards the adsorption of antibiotics is a new and emerging area of study. The rise in use or misuse of antibiotic products has exacerbated their ongoing presence and persistence in the natural environment. Even at low concentrations, antibiotic residues exert pressure on bacterial populations, eventually leading to the emergence of resistant bacteria. Metal-organic frameworks, known for their high porosity, vast specific surface area, and ease of modification, have emerged to be a promising and sustainable antibiotic adsorbent. In an effort to advance the development of this adsorbent, this study provides a state-of-the-art review of recent research published from 2020 to the present, specifically examining the use of MOFs for removing antibiotics from aqueous solutions. Multiple MOF adsorbents were analyzed, with approximately 59% demonstrating significant adsorption capacity within the pH range of 6.0-8.0. In 75% of the instances, the adsorption system reached equilibrium in under 2 hr. Adsorption capacities compared well to other published works in the literature and exceeded conventional adsorbents in many instances. Notable cases of MOF performance were MIL-53(Al) adsorption of amoxicillin (AMX) and SA-g-P3AP@MOF(Fe)/Ag adsorption of neomycin where adsorption capacities of 758.5 and 625.0 mg/g were attained, respectively. The reusability of MOFs was extensively reported at the laboratory batch scale. Analysis of the reported studies revealed the most effective eluents were acetone, ethanol, and methanol, with mostly 3-5 cycles attainable without appreciable loss in efficiency. The recent literature confirmed that MOFs are highly efficient in the adsorption of antibiotics; however, there are some areas that warrant further development. It is intended that this work will bring recent trends to the forefront, identify knowledge gaps, and help guide future research proposals.","[('MOF', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('acetone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ethanol', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39936436,2025,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: The increasing resistance of pathogens to antibiotics poses a major public health challenge. This study aims to develop an innovative approach to combat this resistance by exploring synergies between standard antibiotics and marine metabolites. METHODS: The methodology combines disk diffusion testing and mixture design to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of the combinations. RESULTS: The results demonstrate promising synergies between carotenoids, polyphenols, and alkaloids with standard antibiotics, offering potential targeted use in the fight against clinical multidrug- resistant bacteria. Specifically, Gram-negative bacteria (BGN) showed increased resistance to antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC), ceftazidime, cefotaxime, tetracycline, and cefazolin. These antibiotics, when combined with marine compounds, exhibited substantial inhibitory effects against specific isolates, circumventing antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Similarly, substantial synergies were observed in Gram-positive bacteria. Leveraging advanced algorithms such as multi-objective optimization, notably the NSGA-II algorithm, we accurately predicted minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against clinically resistant bacterial isolates. Optimal conditions against Escherichia coli, characterized by carotenoids = 0.6335, total polyphenols = 0, indole alkaloids = 0.1723, and AMC = 0.1941, yielded a predicted MIC of 41.1126 mg/L, closely mirroring the experimental MIC of 41.66 +/- 0.18 mg/L. Similarly, for Staphylococcus aureus, optimal conditions produced a predicted MIC of 30.8304 mg/L, closely aligning with the experimental MIC of 30.69 +/- 1.80 mg/L. CONCLUSION: The consistent and reliable predictions for bacterial strains affirmed the robustness of the applied methodology. These results not only pave the way for further exploration but also offer valuable insights for optimizing pharmaceutical and medical interventions, presenting innovative avenues for combating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.","[('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefazolin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('indole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE')]"
39936085,2025,"Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) is a gram-positive type of bacteria, typically causing high fever and painful pharyngitis. The bacteria may sometimes trigger widespread skin rash in children, but systemic conditions other than sore throat are rare in adult patients with the infection. A 57-year-old woman visited our hospital with a sore throat, pruritic skin rash in the body trunk, painful oral ulcer, swollen lips, arthralgia, and swollen left wrist joint with pain. She had a recent similar clinical episode approximately four weeks before the hospital visit, which was alleviated with oral loxoprofen. The swelling of the left wrist had migrated from the left elbow area in the preceding four weeks. The patient had similar symptoms about 30 years ago, which were diagnosed with GABHS infection and successfully treated with oral antibiotics. Based on this past similar clinical episode, the patient was evaluated by the GABHS rapid antigen detection tests, which revealed a positive result. The blood test data showed normal white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) level. She was free of any serum antibodies associated with autoimmune connective tissue diseases or syphilis. Deciding the diagnosis was difficult, but based on her past similar clinical episode in her 20s and systemic conditions resembling rheumatic fever, a diagnosis of GABHS-related uncommon systemic response was made. The patient was treated with clarithromycin (200 mg, twice a day) for 10 days and amoxicillin (250 mg, three times a day) for an additional seven days, and all symptoms resolved. Four weeks after the first hospital visit, the serum anti-streptolysin-O (ASO) level was normal at 135 IU/ml. An echocardiogram revealed an anterior mitral leaflet calcification with a mild level of mitral regurgitation. The present case indicated the importance of considering GABHS infection in adults with strong sore throat, widespread skin rash, arthralgia, and swollen joints with uncertain causes, even when the patient is afebrile with normal WBC count, CRP level, and ASO titer.","[('fever', 'DISEASE'), ('painful pharyngitis', 'DISEASE'), ('skin rash', 'DISEASE'), ('sore throat', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('sore throat', 'DISEASE'), ('pruritic', 'DISEASE'), ('rash', 'DISEASE'), ('oral ulcer', 'DISEASE'), ('arthralgia', 'DISEASE'), ('pain', 'DISEASE'), ('loxoprofen', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swelling', 'DISEASE'), ('GABHS infection', 'DISEASE'), ('autoimmune connective tissue diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('syphilis', 'DISEASE'), ('rheumatic fever', 'DISEASE'), ('GABHS-related', 'DISEASE'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('calcification', 'DISEASE'), ('mitral regurgitation', 'DISEASE'), ('GABHS infection', 'DISEASE'), ('sore throat', 'DISEASE'), ('skin rash', 'DISEASE'), ('arthralgia', 'DISEASE'), ('swollen joints', 'DISEASE')]"
39935966,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Aerobic gram-negative bacilli (AGNB) are not part of the resident oral microflora but are occasionally found in high abundance under inflammatory dysbiotic conditions at various oral niches. The aim of the present study was to investigate the identity and antibiotic susceptibility of AGNB isolated from patients in Sweden with mucosal lesions, periodontitis, and peri-implantitis, with special attention to antibiotic resistance and on the presence of phenotypic Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microbiolgical samples were harvested from 211 patients in total, experiencing mucosal lesions (N = 113), periodontitis (N = 62), or peri-implantitis (N = 36). The growth of AGNBs was semiquantified by selective and non-selective culture and the strains were isolated, identified, and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. A total of 251 AGNB strains, occurring in moderate to heavy growth (>100 CFU/ml sample), indicating a dysbiotic microbiota, were identified. The disc diffusion method was used for screening of the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates. Phenotypic identification of ESBL isolates was based on resistance to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime. RESULTS: The most commonly detected AGNB isolates in oral inflammatory dysbiotic conditions were fermentative species belonging to Enterobacteriaceae e.g. Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, and the non-fermentative environmental Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas spp., and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. No clear trends were seen in frequency of the various species in samples from mucosal lesions, severe periodontitis, and peri-implantitis cases. The 138 Enterobacteriaceae isolates and 113 environmental AGNB isolated showed a high antibiotic resistance in general against antibiotics commonly used in dentistry (Amoxicillin, Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid, Ampicillin, Clindamycin, Doxycycline, Erythromycin, Oxacillin, PenicillinV, and Tetracycline). The majority of these isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Ten isolates (4.1%) were phenotypically classified as ESBL positive. The ESBL isolates were predominantly found among isolates of S. maltophilia, while only one ESBL positive isolate was found among Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypically identified ESBL isolates can occasionally be present among oral AGNB strains isolated in abundance from the dysbiotic microbiota occurring in cases with oral mucosal lesions, severe periodontitis, or peri-implantitis.","[('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('peri-implantitis', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('peri-implantitis', 'DISEASE'), ('AGNBs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Citrobacter', 'DISEASE'), ('Enterobacter', 'DISEASE'), ('cepacia', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('peri-implantitis', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Oxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('peri-implantitis', 'DISEASE')]"
39932934,2025,"The presence and distribution of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in rivers have attracted significant global concern. However, research on the contamination of typical rivers in Sichuan Province, China, remains limited. This study aimed to assess the residual levels of antibiotics across 42 national and provincial monitoring sites in nine rivers within Sichuan using UPLC-MS/MS. Ecological risk levels were evaluated through established risk assessment methods, and antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli(E.coli) isolated from these waters was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Additionally, redundancy analysis (RDA) was conducted to explore the impact of residual antibiotics on the microbial community structure in the Minjiang River basin. Antibiotics were detected in all nine rivers studied, with the Minjiang, Tuojiang, and Jialingjiang rivers exhibiting particularly severe contamination, with concentrations ranging from 0.29 to 2233.71 ng/L. The level of antibiotic pollution in the Sichuan Basin was significantly higher than in other regions of Sichuan, likely due to the area's high population density. Furthermore, 9.77% of E. coli isolates from the nine rivers exhibited antibiotic resistance, with over 5.8% demonstrating multidrugs resistance. Norfloxacin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, and tetracycline were identified as the primary contributors to the high ecological risk at 26 of the 42 monitoring sites. A strong correlation was observed between residual antibiotics and changes in microbial community structure. These findings provide critical insights into the distribution of antibiotics and ARGs in the rivers of Sichuan Province and highlight the urgent need for targeted strategies to mitigate antibiotic pollution. Addressing this issue is essential to protect both ecological integrity and public health.","[('Norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39932841,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections are common in pediatrics. Knowledge of local resistance patterns is crucial to guide empirical antibiotic therapy. We aimed to review the pathogens implicated in urinary tract infections, local resistance patterns, and the impact of switching first-line empirical antibiotic regimens. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study including pediatric patients performing urine cultures in a hospital in northern Portugal over two periods: 2019 (group 1) and 2022 (group 2). Between time periods, an internal guideline was implemented recommending cefuroxime as the first-line choice for empirical treatment of urinary tract infections, according to local resistance patterns. Uropathogens, empirical antibiotic choices and resistance patterns were compared among groups. RESULTS: The final sample included 402 cases of urinary tract infections in group 1 and 398 in group 2. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen (79.4 - 83.3%), followed by Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp. The most common empirical antibiotic in group 1 was amoxicillin-clavulanate (A-C), as opposed to cefuroxime in group 2 (p < 0.001). The most common resistance was to ampicillin (39.3% - 39.7%). Resistance to A-C slightly decreased (33.1% vs 27.4%, p = 0.079), while resistance to cefuroxime (4.7% vs 3.3%, p = 0.292) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) remained similar (15.2% vs 14.1%, p = 0.659). Resistances to nitrofurantoin (9.0% vs 0.3%, p < 0.001) and fosfomycin (1.7% vs 0.3%, p < 0.036) significantly decreased from group 1 to group 2. CONCLUSION: E.coli remains the predominant pathogen in pediatric urinary tract infections. Resistance to A-C in our sample was high (33.1%). The switch from A-C to cefuroxime as first-line agent resulted in a decreasing trend in A-C resistance, while cefuroxime resistance remained low and even slightly lower.","[('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus mirabilis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TMP-SMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fosfomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL')]"

39929904,2025,"Analyze the use of antibacterial drugs and bacterial resistance in psychiatric hospital during the epidemic. Using the hospital information system and the National Antibacterial Drug Clinical Application Monitoring Network, we retrospectively collected data on the use of antibacterial drugs and bacterial resistance in psychiatric hospitals during the 2022 epidemic. During the 2022 epidemic, our hospital had an antibiotic use rate of 5.00%, a usage intensity of 3.07, a combined medication rate of 11.11%, a cumulative DDDs of 12,039.04, and antibiotic costs accounting for 3.95% of total drug costs. These are much lower than the levels in Jiangsu Province and nationwide. However, the rate of microbiological submission for antibacterial drug use was 77.78%, higher than that of Jiangsu Province and nationwide. The main antibiotics used in our hospital were third-generation cephalosporins, penicillins, and quinolone antibiotics, with the most commonly used being cefodizime, amoxicillin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The results showed that Gram-negative bacteria mainly exhibited resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and quinolones, especially ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Gram-positive bacteria mainly resisted penicillins, macrolides, and quinolones, especially penicillin, benzylpenicillin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. This study reveals a complex relationship between the rational use of antibacterial drugs and bacterial resistance in the psychiatric hospital. Although antimicrobial usage during the pandemic was generally appropriate, increased use in psychiatric settings correlated with rising bacterial resistance, thereby impacting treatment outcomes and patient prognosis. Therefore, it is recommended to enhance monitoring of bacterial resistance and regularly analyze resistance data to optimize antimicrobial use in psychiatric hospitals. This approach aims to ensure effective treatment while minimizing the development of resistant strains, ultimately improving the overall value of healthcare services.","[('psychiatric', 'DISEASE'), ('psychiatric', 'DISEASE'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('quinolone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefodizime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('piperacillin-tazobactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('quinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amikacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('quinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('benzylpenicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('psychiatric', 'DISEASE'), ('pandemic', 'DISEASE'), ('psychiatric', 'DISEASE'), ('psychiatric', 'DISEASE')]"
39927312,2025,"BACKGROUND: The drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) likely vary substantially by different demographics. However, few complete, open, national detailed data exist on how antibiotic use (ABU) varies by both age and sex. Here, we aimed to describe the variation in ABU and consider how these age- and sex-specific patterns influence targets and methods for AMR control. METHODS: Prescriptions of all antibiotics from general practices in England for 2015-23 disaggregated by 5 year age bands and sex were analysed at the national and Integrated Care Board (ICB) level. A descriptive analysis of the relative rates of ABU by age and sex was conducted, followed by an evaluation of comparison metrics of prescription levels between regions. ABU by age and sex were compared with global AWaRe targets, and ABU by age-group was correlated against influenza vaccination introduction, to evaluate the impact of such vaccines on ABU. RESULTS: From a total of 249 578 795 prescriptions (across 9 years), 63% were given to women and the most prescribed were amoxicillin, nitrofurantoin and flucloxacillin sodium. Prescriptions per 100 000 population varied substantially across sex, age, geographical region, season, year, COVID-19 pandemic period and drug. Most antibiotics were prescribed more to women across most age bands (84% of antibiotics had more prescriptions to females across 50% of age bands). We show how this variation requires a more nuanced approach to comparing ABU across geographies and highlight that AWaRe targets are not met uniformly [prescribing in men aged 11-20 does not fulfil the Access, Watch and Reserve (AWaRe) 80% Access target]. We also show the impact on ABU of time-sensitive interruptions (38% of antibiotics showed a seasonal pattern in the absence of disruptions), including differential age-targeted influenza vaccination, COVID-19 restrictions and a shortage of amoxicillin due to a group A Streptococcus outbreak. However, we found few open data to link age- and sex-specific ABU to relevant AMR. CONCLUSIONS: These detailed differences in ABU across England suggest that there should be large variation in AMR burden by age and sex. Linkage of this ABU data with similarly detailed open-access AMR data is now needed for better intervention design.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('flucloxacillin sodium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pandemic', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39927311,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To monitor the gut colonization by multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria in residents of a single long-term care facility (LTCF) in relation to their clinical evolution, antibiotic consumption and mortality risk. METHODS: In a total of 187 voluntarily enrolled residents, five rectal swabs samples were recovered over 1 year. Selective media were used to isolate MDR bacteria. Clinical data related to infections, antibiotic consumption and mortality were recovered. Mortality risk among residents who were MDR colonized and non-colonized was compared by Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Globally, 25% of residents have gut colonization by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli with a lack of other pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii or Clostridioides difficile. Monitoring of ESBL-producing E. coli colonization for 1 year allowed to us to establish three categories among residents: 48.6% never colonized, 15.5% had a persistent colonization, and the remaining 35.8% presented intermittent colonization. The rates of mortality, infections and antibiotic exposure were comparable among ESBL-producing E. coli colonized and non-colonized residents, except for the intermittent colonization group in which a higher and statistically significant mortality rate was observed. As expected, urinary and respiratory tract infections were the most prevalent infectious pathologies in the LTCF, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and fluoroquinolones being the most prescribed antibiotics. A high percentage of ESBL-producing E. coli (28%), and fluoroquinolone resistance were detected in clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: The monitoring of gut colonization by MDR microorganisms in a single LTCF for 1 year demonstrated the predominance of ESBL-producing E. coli. Almost half of the residents were resistant to its colonization, whereas in 15.5% of them gut colonization was stable.

Due to its invasive nature, susceptibility testing based on endoscopic biopsy is controversial, while few studies have focused on the efficacy of tailored bismuth quadruple therapies (BQT) based on fecal susceptibility testing as a first-line treatment. METHODS: In this multicenter study, 598 H. pylori-positive patients without previous eradication treatment were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: empirical BQT, BQT-tailored based on the history of clarithromycin use and tailored based on fecal molecular susceptibility testing where furazolidone was substituted for clarithromycin when there was clinical or laboratory evidence of clarithromycin resistance. This study defines BQT as regimens comprising rabeprazole, colloidal bismuth, amoxicillin, and one additional antibiotic (furazolidone or clarithromycin). The study assessed eradication rates using intention-to-treat (ITT), modified intention-to-treat (mITT), and per-protocol (PP) analyses. RESULTS: The eradication rates of three groups were 82.00%, 80.90%, and 87.44% in the ITT analysis; 82.41%, 83.42%, and 89.23% in the mITT analysis; and 85.86%, 87.50%, and 94.57% in the PP analysis, respectively. Tailored BQT based on fecal susceptibility testing was not inferior to empirical BQT (all p values for noninferiority < 0.001) and demonstrated greater efficacy in the PP analysis (difference [95% CI]: 7.07% [0.90%, 13.25%]). The incidence of adverse events and treatment compliance did not differ significantly among the groups. CONCLUSION: Tailored BQT based on fecal susceptibility testing is an effective regimen for H. pylori eradication, with no increase in adverse events or treatment noncompliance compared with empirical BQT.

Twenty-hour incubation was sufficient for the assessment of inhibition zone diameters of Fusobacterium strains. Although approved for Prevotella, an extended study of Prevotella species showed inconsistent growth within the EUCAST time limit of 20 h for some strains. All P. gingivalis strains required 44 h of incubation for the evaluation of inhibition zones.

METHODS: We conducted an administrative cohort study using the active comparator new user design with a risk window up to 365 days between January 2013 and December 2019. Population-based longitudinal data from one of the largest German statutory health insurances were used. Episodes of newly dispensed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, norfloxacin, and enoxacin) were compared to other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin clavulanic acid, azithromycin, cefuroxime, cephalexin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and doxycycline). Endpoints were defined by incident diagnoses of aortic aneurysm/dissection, cardiac arrhythmia, hepatotoxicity, and all-cause mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios were estimated from piece-wise exponential additive mixed models with smooth non-linear effects for person-time and age and adjusted for comorbidities, year and quarter at index. RESULTS: The cohorts comprised 15,139,840; 11,760,159; 11,027,175; and 15,305,757 antibiotic episodes. Patients during fluoroquinolone episodes were older (59 versus 51 years) and more often female (58% versus 54%). We counted 46,502; 446,727; 19,125; and 474,411 incident endpoints. Relative risk for all-cause mortality and hepatotoxicity was high for < 40-year- and 40-69-year-old females (aHR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.55-2.03 and aHR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.32-1.53), respectively. For aortic aneurysm/dissection a nominally increased relative risk for < 40-year-old females was found (aHR = 1.42, 95% CI 0.96-2.11), although 95% CI indicates that a small relative risk reduction is also supported by the data. Relative risk for cardiac arrhythmia was increased for men aged < 40 years (aHR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.20). High relative risks for each endpoint were also identified depending on choice of active comparator, and risks increased with higher defined daily doses and shorter follow-up.

RESULTS: A total of 41,135 implants inserted in 17,483 individuals and followed-up for a mean time of 81 +/- 52.33 months. The implant failure rate was 3% at the patient level and 1.6% at the implant level. Hispanic and non-Hispanic ethnic groups showed higher likelihood to have an implant failure than other races, as well as White and African-American races, were more likely to experience implant loss compared to Hispanic patients. Implants placed in patients who received Ciprofloxacin preoperatively showed significantly lower cumulative survival implant time than those who had amoxicillin.

Infantis was identified in chickens (3027 isolated from 18,078 samples; 16.75 %), swine (431/5600; 6.09 %), turkeys (161/4019; 4.01 %), humans (737/18,774; 3.93 %), and cattle (134/8010; 1.67 %). Over the study period, a significant increase in S. Infantis isolates of chickens and turkeys, a moderate in cattle, a low in humans, and no increase in swine was observed. High resistance to tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and sulfisoxazole and low resistance to cefoxitin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were detected among livestock, poultry, and human isolates. Reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was observed in 52.46 % of chicken isolates, 62.11 % of turkey, and 18.59 % of human isolates. Multi-drug resistance (MDR; resistant to at least one agent in >/=3 antimicrobial classes) was detected in 93 % of turkeys, 83 % of chickens, 22 % of humans, 16 % of cattle, and 6 % of swine isolates. This study identified differences in the prevalence and AMR of S. Infantis across the food chain, highlighting the importance of a focused One Health approach to mitigate the emergence of AMR and to reduce the health burden of infections with drug-resistant isolates.","[('S.

39917596,2025,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Antibiotic resistance in Saudi Arabia has led to decreased efficacy of conventional triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication, prompting the development of alternative treatments like levofloxacin-based triple and bismuth-based quadruple therapies. However, comparative data regarding its efficacy are lacking. Therefore, this study's goal was to compare the efficacy of levofloxacin-based triple therapy with that of standard bismuth-based quadruple therapy as first-line regimens. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 197 treatment-naive adults with H. pylori infection who received levofloxacin-based triple (levofloxacin + amoxicillin + PPI) therapy (n = 81) or standard bismuth-based quadruple (bismuth + tetracycline + metronidazole + PPI) therapy (n = 116). H. pylori eradication was evaluated 4-8 weeks after medication administration using the (13)C-urea breath test, and variables that could affect the rate of success were examined. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups in terms of age, sex, nationality, or type of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used. The bismuth-based quadruple therapy group exhibited a markedly superior success rate compared to the levofloxacin-based triple therapy group when the latter was administered for 7 or 10 days (81.03% vs. 6.66%, p < 0.001, and 81.03% vs. 36.1%, p < 0.001, respectively). However, when the levofloxacin-based triple therapy was extended to 14 days, its H. pylori eradication rate became comparable to that of the 10-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy (81.03% vs. 80%, p = 0.898). Eradication rates for both regimens were similar for patients aged >/= 60, non-Saudi, when using omeprazole and those treated with levofloxacin-based triple therapy for 14 days. CONCLUSION: Quadruple treatment based on bismuth is superior to triple therapy based on levofloxacin for eradicating H. pylori in Saudi Arabia and should be used as a first-line treatment. However, the 14-day levofloxacin-based triple treatment had an H. pylori eradication rate comparable to that of the 10-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy.","[('bismuth-based', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth-based', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth-based', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth-based', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth-based', 'CHEMICAL'), ('omeprazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('bismuth-based', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39917156,2025,"Amoxicillin (AMX) is a commonly used antibiotic for treating infections and as a prophylactic antimicrobial agent, appreciated for its efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetics. Drug-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) significantly increases morbidity and mortality. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is classified under thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), which are characterized by hemolysis, low platelet counts, thrombus formation in small vessels, and end-organ damage. While AMX-induced HUS has not been previously reported, AMX can cause AKI through mechanisms such as acute interstitial nephritis and AMX-induced crystal nephropathy (AICN), with AICN being more common. We present the case of a 56-year-old woman who developed AMX-induced HUS and AKI following AMX administration for a tooth infection. A kidney biopsy revealed distinctive glomerular damage, consistent with acute tubular injury and focal segmental glomerulonephritis. The diagnosis of drug-induced kidney injury with concurrent TMA was confirmed. AMX was discontinued, and the patient received plasmapheresis and hemodialysis. Typically, renal impairment is reversible once the offending agent is withdrawn. Physicians should be aware of the potential for AMX-induced HUS.

39917062,2025,"BACKGROUND: Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare autoimmune blistering disease. The induction of LABD by medications is a critical issue, with previous studies highlighting the link between specific drugs and the onset of LABD. This study aims to assess the reported associations between LABD and numerous available medications using the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS). METHODS: The study encompassed FAERS reports spanning the years 2004-2024. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) was used to identify cases of LABD. The Reporting Odds Ratio, Proportional Reporting Ratio, Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, and Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean were calculated to assess the reported associations between available drugs and LABD. A significant statistical association was considered when a drug signal met the criteria of all four algorithms. RESULTS: In the FAERS database analysis, we identified 1,394 adverse event (AE) reports associated with LABD. The gender distribution of reports was relatively balanced, with the highest proportion in the 66-85 age group. The United States had the highest number of reports. Vancomycin and Amoxicillin were the most frequently reported drugs, with 559 and 58 reports, respectively. Through disproportionality analysis, we identified 34 drugs significantly associated with AEs of LABD, including antibiotics, antifungal medications, analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cardiovascular medications, and calcium channel blockers, among which the antibiotic Vancomycin showed the highest association. These results emphasize the need for further clinical attention to the safety of specific medications. CONCLUSION: This is the first real-world study using the FAERS database to investigate drug-induced LABD. LABD is closely associated with antibiotic medications.

In this manuscript, we introduced an innovative computational model named BANNMDA by integrating Bilinear Attention Networks(BAN) with the Nuclear Norm Minimization (NNM) to uncover hidden connections between microbes and drugs. METHODS: In BANNMDA, we initially constructed a heterogeneous microbe-drug network by combining multiple drug and microbe similarity metrics with known microbe-drug relationships. Subsequently, we applied both BAN and NNM to compute predicted scores of potential microbe-drug associations. Finally, we implemented 5-fold cross-validation frameworks to evaluate the prediction performance of BANNMDA. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The experimental results indicated that BANNMDA outperformed state-of-the-art competitive methods. We conducted case studies on well-known drugs such as the Amoxicillin and Ceftazidime, as well as on pathogens such as Bacillus cereus and Influenza A virus, to further evaluate the efficacy of BANNMDA, and experimental outcomes showed that there were 9 out of the top 10 predicted drugs, along with 8 and 9 out of the top 10 predicted microbes having been corroborated by relevant literatures.

Consequently, there is a pressing need for a rapid and precise method to identify bacterial contaminants in drinking water. The objective of this study was to investigate the protein profiles of various bacterial species present in water through the application of protein fingerprinting (PF) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) techniques, as well as to evaluate their antimicrobial resistance. A total of two hundred water samples were collected from five distinct locations within the Qassim region of Saudi Arabia. Bacterial isolates were identified using a protein fingerprinting analytical technique (PFAT), which was subsequently confirmed by real-time PCR. The Kirby-Bauer method was employed to assess antibiotic resistance among the bacterial isolates. Out of the 200 water samples analyzed, PFAT successfully identified 123 bacterial isolates, with the most frequently isolated species being 48 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), 17 Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and 16 Escherichia coli (E. coli). All waterborne bacterial isolates were accurately identified 100% of the time, achieving a score of 2.00 or higher. The results from real-time PCR indicated that 87.5% of P. aeruginosa isolates were positive for the oprI gene, all S. aureus isolates were positive for the nuc gene, and 93.75% of E. coli isolates were positive for the fliC gene. P. aeruginosa isolates demonstrated a high level of resistance to aztreonam (64.6%), while S. aureus exhibited significant resistance to cefoxitin and cefepime (88.24%), followed by aztreonam (82.35%) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (70.6%). E. coli isolates showed complete resistance to ampicillin (100%), with high resistance also observed against amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefoxitin (87.5%), and cefepime (81.25%).

METHODS: A total of 242 RTESF (green salad) samples was collected, different media were used for isolation of different bacterial species. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were identified biochemically and by Gram and capsular staining then isolates were assessed for antimicrobial resistance phenotypically. The ability of biofilm formation was assessed using crystal violet and molecular characterization of ESBLs and virulence genes was done using PCR. RESULTS: A total of 77/242(31.8%) of the recovered isolates was identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae and the resistance percentages were as follow: cefuroxime and cephradine (100%, 77/77), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (98.7%, 76/77), while (27.3%, 21/77) of the isolates were MDR.

39904638,2025,"BACKGROUND: Auricular hematoma is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department among patients presenting with trauma to the ear. It may result in several complications such as perichondritis and cauliflower ear if not managed appropriately. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the evaluation and management of auricular hematoma. DISCUSSION: Auricular hematoma is most commonly associated with shearing or blunt trauma to the ear, resulting in formation of a hematoma within the subperichondrial space. This hematoma obstructs the nutrient supply from the perichondrium to the avascular cartilage. Without a nutrient supply, the ear is at risk for infection, necrosis, and fibrocartilaginous deposition causing cauliflower ear. If a fluctuant hematoma is present within the cartilaginous auricle within 7 days of injury, evacuation should be offered. Prior to the procedure, analgesia should be performed using an auricular block. The hematoma can then be evacuated via needle aspiration or incision and drainage followed by a bolster compression dressing to prevent reaccumulation of blood within this potential space. Despite limited data, 7-10 days of antibiotics are currently recommended with coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eg, fluoroquinolones in adults, amoxicillin-clavulanate in children). This may mitigate the risk of perichondritis. Patients should be reevaluated at 24-48 hours and abstain from contact sports for at least 2 weeks.

This is a retrospective review of all cases of suspected POA referred to the only anaesthetic allergy centre in Malaysia from March 2014 to December 2022. One hundred and ninety patients with suspected POA of Grade 2 and above were included. Data on clinical presentation, severity, management, serum tryptase and subsequent allergy workup (including skin and serum testing results) of these patients were extracted from the database. Dynamic tryptase was elevated in half of the cases where tryptase results were available and skin tests were positive in 96% of these cases. Skin testing was positive in 113 patients (60%) overall, and more than 70% of Grades 3 and 4 anaphylaxis cases. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) and antibiotics were the most commonly identified causative agents (27.4% and 23% respectively). The commonest NMBAs were rocuronium and atracurium, both commonly cross-reacting with cisatracurium. The overall cross-reactivity rate among NMBAs was 58%.

39902253,2025,"Introduction Humankind is suffering from the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, leading to antibiotic resistance. At this point, probiotics, if found effective, can lead to a better future. Probiotics are nothing but a colony of living-friendly bacteria. Lactobacillus reuteri is essential for use as a probiotic among many healthy bacteria. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of probiotics in periodontal treatment. Methods One hundred smokers diagnosed with chronic generalized periodontitis were randomly assigned into two groups. Group A received a seven-day course of amoxicillin 500 mg three a day and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily, followed by 30 days of probiotics, while Group B received a placebo antibiotic for seven days and 30 days of L. reuteri probiotics (2x10(8) CFU daily). Periodontal parameters, including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), attachment loss (AL), and bleeding on probing (BOP), were utilized to asses at baseline, month one, and month one. Baseline differences were adjusted using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) model. Results At month three, Group B (probiotics) showed a significantly lower PI (0.52+/-0.49 vs. 0.88+/-0.52, p<0.001) and a 23% greater reduction in PD (p=0.004) compared to Group A (antibiotics + probiotics). These findings highlight the effectiveness of probiotics alone in improving periodontal health in smokers. Conclusions Both groups showed equal effectiveness in improving periodontal health. Hence, probiotics should be preferred over antibiotics.","[('Lactobacillus reuteri', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('L. reuteri', 'CHEMICAL'), ('PD', 'DISEASE'), ('attachment loss', 'DISEASE'), ('bleeding', 'DISEASE'), ('PD', 'DISEASE')]"
39901998,2025,"Surgical site infections (SSIs) are one of the most common adverse events that occur in hospitalized patients undergoing surgical procedures or in outpatient surgical measures, regardless of the advances in preventive procedures. SSI may lead to disastrous consequences in orthopedic practice as it may involve the joints and bones and is extremely difficult to get rid of the infection. The present study was designed to evaluate the rates, risk factors, microbiological profiles, and outcomes of SSIs following orthopedic procedures in patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Eastern India during the study period of September 2022 to March 2024. A total of 1327 patients who underwent orthopedic surgeries were followed up for the development of SSI, among whom 105 (7.9%) developed SSI, making an incidence rate of 7.9%. The incidence of SSI in different surgeries was 9.5% (34/359) in closed reduction with fixation, 8.5% (65/766) in open reduction with internal fixation, 4.4% (3/69) in hip arthroplasty, and 2.3% (3/133) in knee arthroplasty. Maximum (27.6%) patients having SSI were of the age group of 20-29 years, and 87.62% were males. The habit of smoking was found to be highly statistically significant.

39901301,2025,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial infection has been estimated to become the leading cause of death by 2050, causing 10 million deaths across the globe due to the surge in antibiotic resistance. Despite western sub-Saharan Africa being identified as one of the major hotspots of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) with the highest mortality, a comprehensive regional analysis of the magnitude and key drivers of AMR due to human antibiotic use has not been conducted. METHOD: We carried out a systematic review by conducting a comprehensive search in various databases including PubMed and Scopus for eligible articles published in the English Language between 1 January 2000 and 14 February 2024. Five key domains of antibiotic use were focused on: (1) antibiotic consumption; (2) appropriate antibiotic prescription; (3) indicators or key drivers of antibiotic use; (4) antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions; (5) knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of antibiotic consumers and providers. Data were extracted from eligible papers for all the five domains under consideration and random-effects model meta-analysis was carried out for antibiotic consumption. RESULTS: Out of the 2613 records obtained, 64 articles which were unevenly distributed in the region were eligible for inclusion in our study. These articles reported on antibiotic consumption (5), appropriate antibiotic prescription (10), indicators or key drivers of antibiotic use (10), AMS interventions (10), and 31 studies reported on knowledge, attitudes and perceptions. Antibiotic consumption for inpatients has a pooled estimate of 620.03 defined daily dose (DDD) per 100 bed-days (confidence interval [CI] 0.00-1286.67; I(2) = 100%) after accounting for outliers while prescribing appropriateness ranged from 2.5% to 93.0% with a pooled estimate of 50.09 ([CI: 22.21-77.92%], I(2) = 99.4%). Amoxicillin, gentamicin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, metronidazole, and ceftriaxone were the commonly consumed antibiotics. Community-acquired infection, hospital-acquired infection, and prophylaxis were the major indicators of antibiotic use. AMS was effective to varying degrees with bundled interventions and gamified antimicrobial stewardship decision support application being the most effective. Healthcare workers demonstrated acceptable antibiotic knowledge but individuals from formal and informal settings self-medicate with antibiotics and had moderate to low knowledge of antibiotic use and resistance. CONCLUSION: This review identified gaps in knowledge and highlighted areas where prompt actions are required, it further guides future research endeavors and policy development. The findings underscore the need for further implementation of AMS programs across the West African region to enhance understanding of antibiotic use patterns, prescribing practices, and the factors influencing them in the region.","[('Bacterial infection', 'DISEASE'), ('death', 'DISEASE'), ('deaths', 'DISEASE'), ('AMS', 'DISEASE'), ('AMS', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Community-acquired infection', 'DISEASE'), ('hospital-acquired infection', 'DISEASE'), ('AMS', 'DISEASE'), ('AMS', 'DISEASE')]"
39900044,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Microorganisms isolated from clinical samples in hospitalized patients vary in species and antibiotic sensitivity, depending on whether they are community or healthcare-associated infections. In a hospital in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area, bacterial isolates and their antibiotic resistance were related to the length of hospitalization, as a guide to adjust antibiotic therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microbiological isolates, antibiogram results, and antibiotic treatment of hospitalized patients were recorded weekly between 1/1/2022 and 12/31/2023. Four groups were assigned according to time since hospitalization: G1 (<3 days), G2 (3-7 days), G3 (7-14 days), and G4 (>/=14 days). RESULTS: In the first week of hospitalization, the main microorganism isolated, from community-acquired infection, was Escherichia coli (132 isolates), with high levels of resistance to quinolones, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (82 isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (64 isolates). Between 11/10/23 and 8/12/23, an outbreak of K. pneumoniae carbapenemase MBL was detected in biliodigestive and urological surgery, and it was controlled. Of the antibiotics used: ciprofloxacin went from second in use in G1 and first in G2, to third and fifth in G4. Indications for amoxicillin/sulbactam decreased from G3. Carbapenems and colistin increased from G3. Piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin were widely used in all periods. This simple weekly control allowed us to know the microbiology in the hospital, its antibiotic sensitivity patterns, detect outbreaks, and adjust the rational use of antibiotics, especially empirical, notably in the abuse of ciprofloxacin in urinary or abdominal foci; and compare the isolations and therapeutic behaviors with national and international patterns.","[('healthcare-associated infections', 'DISEASE'), ('community-acquired infection', 'DISEASE'), ('quinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('K. pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/sulbactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colistin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Piperacillin/tazobactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39899706,2025,"PURPOSE: To describe an atypical case of bilateral uveal effusion, presumably triggered by amoxicillin, in a 10-year-old child with pneumonia. METHODS: A comprehensive ophthalmological evaluation and imaging studies, including anterior segment and macular optical coherence tomography, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and B-mode ultrasonography, were performed to assess anatomical changes and confirm the diagnosis. RESULTS: A 10-year-old boy presented with an acute, painless loss of visual acuity in both eyes, primarily affecting distance vision. He had a recent history of pneumonia, which had been treated with amoxicillin. Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral acute myopia, significant refractive error, and shallow anterior chambers in both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography revealed fluid in the supraciliary space and anterior rotation of the ciliary processes, suggestive of uveal effusion. Based on these findings, uveal effusion was suspected, prompting the discontinuation of amoxicillin. The patient was treated with topical dexamethasone, cyclopentolate, and oral azithromycin. After stopping amoxicillin and initiating treatment, the patient's myopia resolved, anterior chamber depth normalized, and the uveal effusion was resolved within three days. The patient remained asymptomatic during a 6-month follow-up period. CONCLUSION: This case suggests a possible link between amoxicillin use and bilateral uveal effusion, a relationship not previously reported. Healthcare professionals should consider uveal effusion in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with bilateral acute myopia, particularly when associated with recent medication use. Further research is needed to explore the potential role of amoxicillin in inducing uveal effusion.","[('uveal effusion', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('loss of visual acuity', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('uveal effusion', 'DISEASE'), ('uveal effusion', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('dexamethasone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cyclopentolate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('uveal effusion', 'DISEASE'), ('uveal effusion', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('uveal effusion', 'DISEASE')]"
39897376,2024,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Colibacillosis is caused by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), which results in significant losses for the poultry sector. It has zoonotic potential and acts as a source of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes for other E. coli. This study aimed to assess phylogenetic groups, virulence factors, and resistance phenotypes of APEC strains isolated from broiler farms in Northern Palestine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 65 APEC isolates were recovered from diseased chickens with typical colibacillosis symptoms from broiler farms located in the northern region of Palestine from May to July 2024. Strains were identified using classical and molecular techniques. Antibiotic resistance was detected using the disk diffusion method. Phylotyping and virulence genotyping of the APEC isolates were performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: This study showed a high detection rate of APEC strains (100%) in chickens. The most APEC strains, 56/65 (86.2%), belonged to group D. Other strains were assigned to groups B2 (5/65, 7.7%), B1 (3/65, 4.6%), and A (1/65, 1.5%). Antibiotic resistance ranged from 27.7% for Polymyxin E (colistin) to 100% for Amoxicillin. Polymyxin E (colistin) and fosfomycin are the most effective drugs. The most common virulence gene was iroN, which was detected in 61 isolates (93.8%). The APEC strains in Palestine exhibit a wide variety of resistance patterns and genetic variations. CONCLUSION: Controlling APEC infections is essential for public health, especially when APEC isolates can pass on resistance and virulence genes to dangerous bacteria such as E. coli that are particular to humans. It is essential to understand APEC pathogenesis, antimicrobial therapy, and the development of measures to control colibacillosis.","[('colibacillosis', 'DISEASE'), ('Polymyxin E', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colistin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Polymyxin E', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colistin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fosfomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('APEC infections', 'DISEASE'), ('APEC', 'DISEASE'), ('colibacillosis', 'DISEASE')]"
39897375,2024,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus aureus are common colonizing pathogens in companion animals. These opportunistic pathogens can cause infections of varying frequency and severity in humans and pets. Studies on Staphylococcus colonization in veterinarians are scarce. This study aimed to investigate the colonization of the nostrils and hands by S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and S. pseudintermedius among healthy clinical practice veterinarians in the province of Malaga (Spain), with a particular focus on their potential antibiotic resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A request for voluntary participation was extended to professionals from the Official College of Veterinarians of Malaga. Nasal and hand swabs were collected by two trained technicians in January 2024, and all samples were delivered to the laboratory within 24 h. Gram staining, catalase, oxidase, and coagulase tests were performed. The susceptibility of the isolated bacteria to 11 antibiotics was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 50 clinical practice veterinarians were enrolled in the study, comprising 36 women and 14 men from 31 veterinary clinics across Malaga province. A total of 32% of the nasal samples yielded S. aureus, whereas 64% were found to contain S. epidermidis. In total, 30% of the hand samples yielded S. aureus and 30% yielded S. epidermidis. The participants did not exhibit any strains of S. pseudintermedius in their nasal samples or hands. Two strains (11.1%) of methicillin-resistant S. aureus were isolated from 18 strains isolated from nostrils. Furthermore, a high prevalence of S. aureus strains resistant to ampicillin (94.4%) and amoxicillin (72.2%) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The colonization profiles of veterinary professionals were similar to those observed in the general population.

39895369,2025,"BACKGROUND: Data from surveillance on antibiotic resistance have shown an increasing prevalence of non-enzymatic resistance (beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant) to beta-lactam antibiotics among H. influenzae strains in the Czech Republic. Aminopenicillins are recommended agents for non-invasive Haemophilus influenzae infections. The phenomenon of non-enzymatic resistance to beta-lactams is complicated by the fact that the phenotypic detection of PBP3 with specific amino acid substitutions (rPBP3) is challenging, since rPBP3 isolates have repeatedly been demonstrated to be split by the epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFF) for aminopenicillins defined by EUCAST. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether the penicillin disc has sufficient detection ability to predict the non-enzymatic mechanism; whether other antibiotics can be used for detection; and what is the agreement between the broth microdilution and disc diffusion methods. METHODS: We undertook susceptibility testing of selected antibiotics according to EUCAST of 153 rPBP3 strains, and sequencing of the ftsI gene to determination amino acid substitutions. RESULTS: For a selected set of rPBP strains: (i) the detection capability for penicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime and amoxicillin/clavulanate was found to be 91.5%, 94.4%, 89.5% and 70.6%, respectively; (ii) the categorical agreement between the disc diffusion method and the MIC for ampicillin and cefuroxime was 71.1% and 83.8%, respectively.

The circumstances surrounding H. influenzae have been changing owing to changes in antimicrobial usage. In the present study, to determine the current situation of H. influenzae, the antimicrobial susceptibility trends were investigated. In total, 21 clinical isolates were analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility measured using the broth dilution method was compared with that reported in previous studies at the same hospital. Quinolone low-susceptible isolates were further characterized by multi-locus sequence typing. Upon comparing the susceptibility data in 2022 with those in the past 15 years, the number of beta-lactamase nonproducing ampicillin-resistant isolates was decreased. Regarding recent changes, beta-lactam-susceptible isolates were found to have gradually increased every year. However, beta-lactamase-producing isolates did not decrease. In particular, the ratio of beta-lactamase-producing amoxicillin and clavulanic acid-resistant isolates in 2022 was the highest among all the years studied. Moreover, quinolone low-susceptible isolates were still present, suggesting that these isolates could have been indigenized in the community. Furthermore, a beta-lactamase-producing amoxicillin and clavulanic acid-resistant isolate was found to have emerged among the quinolone low-susceptibility isolates.

In addition, this study provided data on the hygiene and handling practices of vendors, which can help as impute to improve food safety and safeguard public health. A total of 242 salad samples were collected from three different kebeles and examined for the presence of Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7 in the microbiology laboratory of Jimma University by using conventional microbiological techniques. RESULTS: Out of 242 samples tested, 12.8% (31/242) were contaminated with Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157. Of these, Salmonella spp. was detected in 10.7% (26/242) of the tested samples, whereas Escherichia coli O157:H7 was found in 2.1% (5/242) of samples. Fifty-three-point-8% of Salmonella spp. were resistant to ampicillin, 42.3% to co-trimoxazole, 46.2% to tetracycline, and 26.9% resistance was observed against each of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. 40% of E. coli O157:H7 isolates were resistant against ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and co-trimoxazole.

Recent advances in microbiological epidemiology have highlighted staphylococci and enterococci as the primary pathogens involved. AIM: To investigate the prevalence of these bacteria in patients' cutaneous flora before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedures, and to assess the implications for antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations. METHODS: A single-centre prospective epidemiological study was conducted, enrolling patients admitted consecutively for transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedures between June 2021 and February 2022. Cutaneous samples were obtained from each patient at the puncture site of the transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedure, before and after skin detersion, and from operator hands after skin detersion. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included, with a mean age of 82+/-6.1years, a male-to-female ratio of 0.48 and a mean body mass index of 29+/-4.4kg/m(2).

39888618,2025,"IMPORTANCE: Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common indication for outpatient antimicrobial therapy. National guidelines for the management of uncomplicated UTI were published in 2011, but the extent to which they align with current practices, patient diversity, and pathogen biology, all of which have evolved greatly in the time since their publication, is not fully known. OBJECTIVE: To reevaluate the effectiveness and adverse event profile for first-line antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and oral beta-lactams for treating uncomplicated UTI in contemporary clinical practice. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, population-based cohort study used a claims dataset from Independence Blue Cross, which contains inpatient, outpatient, laboratory, and pharmacy claims that occurred between 2012 and 2021, formatted into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Participants were nonpregnant female individuals aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of uncomplicated, nonrecurrent UTI at an outpatient setting. Patients must also have been treated with first-line (nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or ofloxacin), or oral beta-lactam (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefadroxil, or cefpodoxime) antibiotics. Data analysis was performed from November 2021 to August 2024. EXPOSURES: Patients exposed to first-line antibiotics were assigned to the treatment group, and those exposed to fluoroquinolone or beta-lactam treatments were assigned to control groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite end point for treatment failure, defined as outpatient or inpatient revisit within 30 days for UTI, pyelonephritis, or sepsis. Secondary outcomes were the risk of 4 common antibiotic-associated adverse events: gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, kidney injury, and Clostridium difficile infection. RESULTS: There were 57 585 episodes of UTI among 49 037 female patients (mean [SD] age, 51.7 [20.1]) years), with prescriptions for first-line antibiotics in 35 018 episodes (61%), fluoroquinolones in 21 140 episodes (37%), and beta-lactams in 1427 episodes (2%). After adjustment, receipt of first-line therapies was associated with an absolute risk difference of -1.78% (95% CI, -2.37% to -1.06%) for having a revisit for UTI within 30 days of diagnosis vs fluoroquinolones. First-line therapies were associated with an absolute risk difference of -6.40% (95% CI, -10.14% to -3.24%) for 30-day revisit compared with beta-lactam antibiotics. Differences in adverse events were similar between all comparators. Results were identical for models built with an automated OMOP feature extraction package. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients with uncomplicated UTI derived from a large regional claims dataset, national treatment guidelines published almost 14 years ago continue to recommend optimal treatments. These results also provide proof-of-principle that automated feature extraction methods for OMOP formatted data can emulate manually curated models, thereby promoting reproducibility and generalizability.","[('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('UTI', 'DISEASE'), ('Blue', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oral beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefadroxil', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefpodoxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pyelonephritis', 'DISEASE'), ('sepsis', 'DISEASE'), ('antibiotic-associated', 'DISEASE'), ('gastrointestinal symptoms', 'DISEASE'), ('rash', 'DISEASE'), ('kidney injury', 'DISEASE'), ('Clostridium difficile infection', 'DISEASE'), ('UTI', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL')]"

N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and Vitamin C (Vit C) are antioxidants and supplements, consumed for their beneficial properties. The present investigation evaluates the effect of their antioxidant property on antibiotic efficacy against Escherichia coli cells from different physiological states, including exponential and stationary-phase, cell aggregates, and in-vitro stress-induced persister cells. Survival was measured in cfu/mL by cfu (colony-forming unit) counting, with efficacy determined by log-fold change in survival by comparing CFUs in antibiotics alone and antibiotic + antioxidant combinations. Fluoroquinolones in the presence of NAC reduced  approximately 1 log CFUs of log-phase and persister cells, while Vit C reduced CFUs ( approximately 1-3-log increase) of cells from all physiological states. Aminoglycosides results were inconclusive; streptomycin's activity declined ( approximately 1-3-log increase in survival), whereas amikacin's activity potentiated ( approximately 1-log reduction in cfu/mL). Rifampicin's showed reduced activity ( approximately 2-3 log increase in survival) with Vit C in all the states and a  approximately 1-2 log increase with NAC, especially in cell aggregates and persisters. Beta-lactams activity showed variability, with amoxicillin and ampicillin not being influenced, but ceftriaxone showed significant reduction of efficacy ( approximately 2-3-log increase in survival) in all the treatments.

39885529,2025,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication regimens may have different effects on the gut microbiota. Few studies have analyzed the safety of high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) from a micro-ecological perspective. This study aimed to compare the impact of H. pylori eradication with HDDT and bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) on gut microbiota. PATIENTS AND METHODS: H. Pylori-infected treatment-naive patients were recruited and screened from September 2023 to April 2024 and randomly assigned to the HDDT group (esomeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 750 mg, qid, 14 days) or BQT group (esomeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and bismuth potassium citrate 600 mg, bid, 14 days). Fresh stool specimens were collected and stored before treatment and at week 2 and week 8 after treatment. The diversity and composition of the gut microbiota were compared and analyzed in both groups using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: Forty-nine H. pylori positive patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the HDDT (n = 24) or the BQT group (n = 25) group. Compared with baseline, alpha and beta diversities significantly changed at week 2 after receiving BQT and did not recover fully at week 8. However, in the HDDT group, the diversities at week 2 changed mildly without statistical significance, compared to baseline. Additionally, a greater number of species had alterations in their abundances in the BQT group compared to the HDDT group at week 2. However, the abundances of these species were restored to their previous levels at week 8 in both the HDDT and BQT groups.

Environmental samples were collected from six pig farms, and the same pigs were also sampled at the slaughterhouses. Palatine tonsils, mesenteric lymph nodes, colon content, and carcass surface samples were collected and tested for Salmonella and Y. enterocolitica. Antimicrobial resistance testing and whole genome sequencing were performed on all isolates. Carcass surface samples were tested for total aerobic colony count (ACC) and Enterobacteriaceae count (EBC). Y. enterocolitica was found in two farms (33%), while Salmonella was absent in environmental farm samples. At slaughterhouses, 13.1% of pigs were found positive for Salmonella (lymph nodes, colon content, and palatine tonsils samples), but Y. enterocolitica was not detected. Salmonella isolates were typed as monophasic S. Typhimurium ST34 and S. Goldcoast ST358, with few allelic differences among isolates of the same ST. Salmonella ST34 showed resistance towards ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline (blaTEM-1B, aph(3 )-Ib, sul2 and tetB genes, R-type ASSuT). Y. enterocolitica isolates (biotype 2, ST853, and ST859) showed resistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (blaA gene).

39877078,2025,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, bacteria isolated from companion animals in China were taxonomically identified and assessed for antimicrobial susceptibility to evaluate the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pets. METHODS: From October 2022 to October 2023, 5468 samples were collected from pets, predominantly from cats and dogs, in China, of which 5253 bacterial strains were identified (>98%). Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using the VITEK 2 COMPACT system and the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The most common bacterial species were Escherichia coli (14.5%) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (13.6%). E. coli exhibited high resistance to ampicillin and cefpodoxime (56.8%-73.2%) but moderate resistance to doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate (18.1%-38.5%). Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. were resistance to several antimicrobials (32.2%-57.7%). High susceptibility to imipenem was noted in Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Acinetobacter spp. (91.7%-94.1%). Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp. demonstrated higher resistance than coagulase-negative strains. Enterococcus faecium showed greater resistance to some antimicrobials compared with E. faecalis. Streptococcus spp. exhibited low resistance to enrofloxacin (1.6%) and penicillin (1.1%).

Given the high global rates of morbidity and mortality associated with this disease, there is an urgent need to explore alternative therapeutic agents to enhance treatment options. This study investigates the anti-leptospiral efficacy of several common antibiotics-penicillin G, doxycycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin, as well as extracts from local herbs, Hydnophytum formicarum Jack and Boesenbergia stenophylla, against pathogenic and intermediate Leptospira strains. A broth microdilution method determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the antibiotics and herb extracts. Both herbs were extracted using four different solvents: ethyl acetate, methanol, hexane, and chloroform. The extracts were then analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify their phytochemical compounds. The results demonstrated that cefotaxime and erythromycin exhibited the highest anti-leptospiral activity, with MIC values of 0.2 microg/mL. This was followed by amoxicillin and ampicillin (0.2-0.39 microg/mL), penicillin G (0.39-3.13 microg/mL), chloramphenicol (0.78-3.13 microg/mL), and doxycycline (0.78-12.5 microg/mL). H. formicarum Jack and B. stenophylla extract extractions displayed the lowest MICs (62.5 microg/mL) for the ethyl acetate, methanol, and hexane extracts. They contained various phytochemical constituents, including some with anti-leptospiral properties. These findings indicate that different strains of Leptospira respond with varying levels of inhibition to the antibiotics and herb extracts studied.

39875613,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Haemophilus influenzae plays a major role in invasive bacterial infections. Resistant strains are emerging, prompting the WHO to include H. influenzae on its list of priority pathogens for research and development of new antibiotics. PURPOSE: We aimed to describe the serotypes, demographics and susceptibility profiles of invasive strains collected in Belgium. METHODS: Data on invasive strains referred to the Belgian National Reference Center for H. influenzae from 2018 to 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 608 invasive strains were included. The number of notifications per year ranged from 85 to 165, with a marked decrease between 2020 and 2021. The highest incidence rate was observed in Brussels (1.56 per 100,000 inhabitants over the five year 2018-2022). Sex and age distribution were in line with global trends, as was the predominance of the non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHI). Beta-lactam resistance varies between molecules: 18.9% for ampicillin, 5.6% for amoxicillin-clavulanate. Mutations in the ftsI gene associated with decreased susceptibility to beta-lactams increased from 11.5 to 17.7% over the period studied. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced the epidemiology of invasive H. influenzae infections in Belgium. Demographic analysis identified a significant male predominance among infants, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.57 in patients under one year of age, a high figure not previously reported in the literature. The continued predominance of NTHI underscores the efficacy of Hib vaccination, although the emergence of Hib in patients younger than five years in 2022 suggests an alarming serotype dynamic. The detection of meropenem resistance also highlights the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, while the increase in ftsI gene mutations raises concerns about the efficacy of first-line treatment.

This research delves into exploring the mechanisms underlying the ability of amoxicillin to boost NK cell cytotoxicity in NK cell immunotherapy. Amoxicillin significantly enhances the cytotoxic activity of NK-92MI cells against MCF-7 cells by triggering the initiation of a cytolytic program in target cell-deficient NK-92MI cells and augmenting the degranulation level of NK-92MI cells in the presence of target cells. The ability of NK cells to recognize target cells was increased upon exposure to amoxicillin at low concentration (10 ng/mL). Additionally, the utilization of amoxicillin loaded in liposome (AMO@Liposome) for NK cell immunotherapy in a mouse breast cancer model resulted in an increased antitumor effect in comparison to without the treatment of AMO@Liposome. RNA transcriptome analysis showed that amoxicillin upregulated differential genes related to the synaptic vesicle cycle pathway and calcium signaling pathway, and FOSB, TNFRSF18, and H4C1 were identified as critical players.

39870739,2025,"Antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus pose a significant threat in healthcare, demanding urgent therapeutic solutions. Combining bacteriophages with conventional antibiotics, an innovative approach termed phage-antibiotic synergy, presents a promising treatment avenue. However, to enable new treatment strategies, there is a pressing need for methods to assess their efficacy reliably and rapidly. Here, we introduce a novel approach for real-time monitoring of pathogen lysis dynamics employing the piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) with dissipation (QCM-D) technique. The sensor, a QCM chip modified with the bacterium S. aureus RN4220 DeltatarM, was utilized to monitor the activity of the enzyme lysostaphin and the phage P68 as model lytic agents. Unlike conventional QCM solely measuring resonance frequency changes, our study demonstrates that dissipation monitoring enables differentiation of bacterial growth and lysis caused by cell-attached lytic agents. Compared to reference turbidimetry measurements, our results reveal distinct alterations in the growth curve of the bacteria adhered to the sensor, characterized by a delayed lag phase. Furthermore, the dissipation signal analysis facilitated the precise real-time monitoring of phage-mediated lysis. Finally, the QCM-D biosensor was employed to evaluate the synergistic effect of subinhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic amoxicillin with the bacteriophage P68, enabling monitoring of the lysis of P68-resistant wild-type strain S. aureus RN4220. Our findings suggest that this synergy also impedes the formation of bacterial aggregates, the precursors of biofilm formation. Overall, this method brings new insights into phage-antibiotic synergy, underpinning it as a promising strategy against antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains with broad implications for treatment and prevention.","[('S. aureus RN4220', 'DISEASE'), ('lysostaphin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('S. aureus RN4220', 'DISEASE')]"

IV methods estimated risk differences (RD) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) for penicillin versus other antibiotics. The RD for resistance was 11.4% (95% CI: 7.6%, 15.4%) for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 14.1% (95% CI: 9.0%, 19.4%) for ampicillin, and 0.8% (95% CI: 0.2%, 1.4%) for piperacillin/tazobactam, with NNHs of 8.8, 7.1, and 122.0, respectively. Risks declined over time since exposure. Gentamicin, used as a negative control, showed no effect (95% CI: -2.4%, 1.8%).

Oral treatment with moxifloxacine or amoxicillin-clavulanate + ciprofloxacin has already been widely tested and is actually a standard of care for a meticulously selected group of patients managed as ambulatory patients. Intravenous treatment of febrile neutropenia is a major challenge for clinicians and microbiologists since the blast of the ""silent pandemic"" of antimicrobial resistance. SUMMARY: In this setting, strategies that reduce the chances of febrile neutropenia, misuse of antibiotics and enhance the rigorous control of infections may offer a chance to improve the management of febrile neutropenia and offer to our patients the chance to continue their antineoplastic treatment without perturbations.","[('Febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('granulocyte-colony', 'CHEMICAL'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('moxifloxacine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE')]"
39867921,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is becoming more resistant to antibiotics, and the implementation of individualized therapy is highly valuable for its eradication. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of individualized treatment guided by antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) with a 10-day or 14-day course for the eradication of H. pylori. METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, single-center, quasi-randomized trial in which 220 participants were randomized into groups based on AST results as AST-10-day (n = 98) and AST-14-day (n = 112) treatment groups. All participants were retested for a 14-carbon urease breath test at weeks 4-8 after the end of the treatment. RESULTS: The primary resistance rates of H. pylori to metronidazole, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin were 94.1% (207/220), 42.7% (95/220), 41.4% (91/220), and 0.9% (2/220), respectively; however, no resistance to furazolidone and tetracycline was observed. In the AST-10-day and AST-14-day groups, the intention-to-treat (ITT) eradication rates were 89.8% (88/98) and 90.2% (110/122), respectively, with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.928). The per-protocol (PP) eradication rates were 92.6% (88/95) and 98.2% (110/112), respectively, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.049). The incidence rates of adverse events (AEs) in the AST-10-day and AST-14-day groups were 6.3% (6/95) and 7.2% (8/112), respectively, with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.813). No statistically significant difference was observed in compliance between the two groups (p = 0.467). CONCLUSION: Both 10-day and 14-day AST guided individualized therapy can achieve satisfactory eradication effect. Compared with the 14-day regimen, the 10-day regimen has similar eradication rate and incidence of adverse events and compliance but shorter duration and lower cost.","[('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('furazolidone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39867757,2025,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Chronic suppurative otitis media is a fatal condition owing to its propensity for intracranial extension. The inadvertent use of antibiotics has led to resistance among causative organisms. The objectives of this study were to determine causative bacteria, their antibiotic resistance and susceptibility patterns, and their response to antibiotics after a one-month follow-up. METHOD: It was a prospective study conducted in the ENT department of Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar from June 2023 to March 2024. Ear swabs were collected for microscopy and bacterial culture. Statistical analysis was done using IBM-SPSS-20, and GraphPad Prism. RESULTS: Data was collected from 113 patients. The mean age of the patients was 22 + 2 years. Out of 113 samples, 97(85.5%) showed growth on culture whereas 16(14%) showed no growth, with 95 (98%) unimicrobial, while 2 (2%) showed polymicrobial growth. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest bacteria isolated 38(38%), followed by S. aureus, Proteus species, and S. saprophyticus. Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to Linezolid (80%), followed by Vancomycin (76%), with resistance to Ciprofloxacin (75-84%), Ampicillin (70%), and Ceftriaxone (75-80%). Gram-negative bacteria showed susceptibility to carbapenem (50-100%) and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (50% to 93%), with resistance to Ciprofloxacin (50-87%), Ceftriaxone (87%), and Amoxicillin/Clavulanate (72-90%). After one month of follow-up, 82% of patients showed improvements, with noncompliance significantly associated with the persistence of symptoms (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Moderate to high resistance against ciprofloxacin, third-generation cephalosporin, ampicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanate, and clindamycin is an eye-opener. Our results underscore the critical need for judicious administration of empirical antibiotics.","[('Chronic suppurative otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus', 'DISEASE'), ('Linezolid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbapenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Piperacillin/Tazobactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin/Clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39867021,2024,"Combined risk factors such as total gastrectomy, heavy alcohol consumption, smoking, and poor oral hygiene may contribute to the development of pulmonary actinomycosis. Here, we present a rare case of pulmonary actinomycosis triggered by total gastrectomy and heavy alcohol consumption. The patient presented with hemoptysis and a suspected lung mass. With a history of total gastrectomy and heavy alcohol consumption, the patient underwent imaging studies that initially suggested lung cancer. While imaging studies initially suggested lung cancer, multiple bronchoscopic examinations ultimately led to a diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis, following an initial biopsy that revealed chronic bronchitis. The patient was treated with oral amoxicillin (1,500 mg/day for six months) alongside comprehensive dental care, including periodontal therapy and dental restorations. This approach resulted in significant clinical improvement, with no recurrence of hemoptysis and favorable findings on chest X-ray. This case highlights the intricate interplay of risk factors in the development of pulmonary actinomycosis. It underscores the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary treatment strategy combining antibiotic therapy and dental care, which improved the patient's condition and avoided unnecessary interventions such as lung resection.","[('alcohol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pulmonary actinomycosis', 'DISEASE'), ('pulmonary actinomycosis', 'DISEASE'), ('alcohol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hemoptysis', 'DISEASE'), ('alcohol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('lung cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('lung cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('pulmonary actinomycosis', 'DISEASE'), ('chronic bronchitis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hemoptysis', 'DISEASE'), ('pulmonary actinomycosis', 'DISEASE')]"

We assessed UTI prevalence, etiology, antimicrobial resistance, and associated risk factors among pregnant women receiving antenatal care in rural Amhara, Ethiopia. 604 pregnant women were screened for UTI at </= 24 weeks gestational age from August 2020 to June 2022. Urine culture, dipstick, and antibiotic sensitivity testing were completed. We conducted descriptive statistics for prevalence and logistic regression to examine UTI risk factors. UTI prevalence was 3.5% (21/604, 95%CI = 2.0%-4.9%), among which 43% were symptomatic and 57% were asymptomatic. Common uropathogens were Escherichia coli (57.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.3%), and Enterococcus faecalis (14.3%). Among all isolates, resistance was high for ampicillin (66.7%) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (40.0%). The majority of isolates (76.2%) were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, cotrimoxazole, and cefpodoxime. Maternal age > 20 years was a protective factor against UTI (OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.10-0.77; ref < 20 years).

39866847,2025,"A systematic review was conducted to critically analyze the outbreaks, efficacy, and safety of drugs used to treat various Salmonella infections. Four drugs-azithromycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and amoxicillin-are commonly used to treat Salmonella infections, and all four drugs were included in this review. This review found that, of these, azithromycin and ceftriaxone were more effective in treating Salmonella infections based on the patient's length of stay in the hospital and the rate at which the fever was resolved. Fluoroquinolones are also effective in treating Salmonella infection but are not approved for use in children. Azithromycin was found to be the physicians' preferred choice of medication for Salmonella infection due to its less resistance development. Almost all these drugs produce varying degrees of adverse events, but they are mild to moderate. However, azithromycin was shown to be comparatively safer than the other three drugs in terms of side effects, adverse events, and relapse associated with Salmonella treatment. Developing effective and safe therapies for all strains of Salmonella remains a priority, especially given the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant variants.","[('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Salmonella infections', 'DISEASE'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Salmonella infections', 'DISEASE'), ('fever', 'DISEASE'), ('Fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Salmonella infection', 'DISEASE'), ('Azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Salmonella infection', 'DISEASE'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39866402,2025,"Klebsiella spp. present in the food chain have been of much interest during the last few decades due to their implication in the development of antimicrobial resistance. We determined the prevalence of Klebsiella spp. (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca) in retail poultry meat, along with their resistance profile against antimicrobials. For the detection of the Klebsiella spp. a total of 285 raw meat samples of retailed poultry were collected and cultured. All positive cultures were screened for Klebsiella spp. by PCR to confirm the identity. Their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was performed using the disk diffusion technique, whereas the ESBL-coding genes were detected using the multiplex PCR technique. Out of 285 samples, 139 (48.77 %) raw meat samples had Klebsiella spp. While out of 139 identified positive isolates, 99 (34.74 %) isolates were K. pneumoniae, and 13 (4.56 %) were K. oxytoca. Phenotypically, most of the strains were fully (100 %) resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and nalidixic acid. Of the beta-Lactamase genes that were detected through mPCR, bla (SHV) was the dominant gene among the strains K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca isolates, with percentages of 86.87 % and 76.92 %, respectively. Besides, isolates of K. p n eumoniae harbored 95.96 % (95 % CI: 89.98-98.89) of the tetA gene, whereas the K. oxytoca isolates harbored only 92.31 % (95 % CI: 63.97-99.81) of the tetA gene. Most of the K. pneumonia e and K. oxytoca isolates were found to harbor the streptomycin-resistant gene, strA.

39866024,2025,"Amoxicillin is commonly used to treat erythema migrans in the first stage of Lyme disease in children, with a recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day, administered three times a day (q8h). This model-based simulation study aimed to determine whether splitting the same daily dose into two administrations (q12h) would provide comparable drug exposure. A pharmacokinetic model suitable for a pediatric population (age: 1 month to 18 years, weight: 4-80 kg) was selected through a literature review. Simulations were performed with 15,000 virtual patients receiving 16.67 mg/kg/dose q8h, 25 mg/kg/dose q12h, or other q12h dosing variations. The target therapeutic level was defined by the percentage of time that the unbound drug concentration remained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (% fT > MIC) specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, with MICs of 0.06, 0.25, 1, 2, and 4 mg/L, requiring at least 40% and 50% of time for effective treatment. Probability of target attainment (PTA) was considered acceptable if it exceeded 50%, allowing for comparison of dosing schedules. Results indicated that the 50 mg/kg/day divided q12h regimen provided similar drug exposure to the q8h regimen for MICs below 2 mg/L (PTAs >50%). For a MIC of 2 mg/L, PTA was achieved with a higher dose of 30 mg/kg/dose q12h. However, for a MIC of 4 mg/L, the PTA criterion was not met. These findings suggest that a twice-daily dosing of 25 mg/kg/dose provides comparable bactericidal activity to the thrice-daily regimen for MICs between 0.06 and 1 mg/L. This simplified regimen may improve adherence and treatment implementation in children.","[('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythema migrans', 'DISEASE'), ('Lyme disease', 'DISEASE'), ('q8h', 'CHEMICAL'), ('q12h', 'CHEMICAL'), ('mg/kg/dose q8h', 'CHEMICAL'), ('mg/kg/dose q12h', 'CHEMICAL'), ('q12h', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('q12h', 'CHEMICAL'), ('q8h', 'CHEMICAL'), ('mg/kg/dose', 'CHEMICAL'), ('mg/kg/dose', 'CHEMICAL')]"

The fever occured especially in the afternoon to evening, and is not accompanied by chills and sweating. On day 4 of fever onset, the fever diminished and the spots progressively widened with swelling. On day 7, the lesions on the skin became open wounds that were not purulent and did not bleed. On day 9, a blackish, painless layer appeared over the wounds and widened, further covering their surface. Upon presentation, the patient's general condition was good, with normal vital signs and temperature. He presented with a solitary ulcer accompanied by edema, sized 1 cm x 3 cm, not hyperemic, firm border, flat edge, and covered with blackish eschar. Blood tests revealed normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelets, kidney and liver function. The anti-anthrax protective antigen (anti-PA) IgG level is found to be seropositive with a level of 85 U/ml. Gram staining of the tissue underneath the eschar found Gram-positive rod bacteria in reddish-purple color. The patient was clinically diagnosed with probable cutaneous anthrax, and was treated with amoxicillin 500 mg orally t.i.d. for three days and paracetamol 500 mg if fever developed. The tissue sample was sent to a laboratory with Bio Safety level 3 facilities for microbiological culture, with the results of Bacillus anthracis growth. On day three after antibiotic administration, the wound was smaller (0.5 cm x 1.5 cm), firm border, flat edge, with a bit of edema above it. The eschar was thickened, painless, not purulent nor bleeding. Antibiotic administration is continued for another three days with amoxicillin 500 mg orally t.i.d. On day 6 of antibiotic administration, the eschar began to peel off, and antibiotics were stopped. On the 10th day, the eschar peeled off entirely without leaving a mark.

39858977,2025,"Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one of the most common pathogens in both humans and livestock. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of E. coli isolated from raw cow milk and evaluate its antimicrobial resistance rates. A total of 1696 milk samples were collected from Romanian dairy farms from 2018 to 2022. E. coli was isolated on various selective agar media, such as Cled agar and Columbia Agar with 5% Sheep Blood. The identification of E. coli was performed by MALDI-TOF MS. E. coli isolates were tested for their susceptibility against 18 commonly used antibiotics in a disk diffusion method. The overall prevalence of E. coli was 22.45% of all isolated pathogens. Antibiogram analysis revealed that 27.51% of E. coli isolates from milk were multidrug-resistant. Resistance was highest for penicillin-novobiocin (87.78%), followed by streptomycin (53.7%). Resistance to six drugs (amoxicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin-cephalexin, marbofloxacin, ampicillin) showed a significant increasing trend over time, while for two drugs (penicillin G-framycetin, doxycycline), a significant decrease was observed. Our results suggest that milk can be a reservoir of bacteria with the potential for infection in humans via the food chain.

39858388,2025,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest challenges of our time, urging researchers in both veterinary and public health to engage in collaborative efforts, thereby fostering the One Health approach. Infections caused by Staphylococcus species can not only lead to significant diseases in poultry but also pose serious threats to human life, particularly in hospital (nosocomial) infections; therefore, it is crucial to identify their antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: Our objective was to assess the susceptibility profile of commensal Staphylococcus aureus strains (n = 227) found in commercial chicken flocks in Hungary through the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. RESULTS: Based on our findings, resistance to tiamulin (82.8%; 95% CI: 77.4-87.2%) and doxycycline (74.4%; 95% CI: 68.5-79.7%) is the most critical. The 55.1% (95% CI: 48.8-61.3%) resistance rate to enrofloxacin, a critically important antimicrobial, is also concerning. The fact that 58.6% (95% CI: 52.4-64.5%) of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin and 35.7% (95% CI: 29.7-42.1) were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid suggests that a proportion of the strains produce beta-lactamase. Comparing our results with the available human hospital data, it was found that resistance to macrolide antibiotics is similarly high in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the necessity of conducting regular surveillance studies, which would allow the monitoring of future temporal trends. This information could benefit practitioners making clinical decisions to successfully treat infections.

39858384,2025,"The rising threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global concern in both human and veterinary medicine, with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius presenting significant challenges. Background/Objectives: This study evaluates the effectiveness of amoxicillin against these MDR pathogens in canine isolates using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and mutation prevention concentration (MPC) were assessed. Additionally, time-kill assays and post-antibiotic effect (PAE) assessments were performed. Epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) values were established for both species to guide therapy. Results: S. aureus had a higher resistance rate (35.89%) than S. pseudintermedius (15.27%), with MIC50 values of 0.50 mug/mL and 0.25 mug/mL, respectively. The MPC analysis revealed that S. pseudintermedius required higher antibiotic concentrations (16.11 mug/mL) to prevent mutations compared to S. aureus (2.20 mug/mL). Time-kill assays indicated that higher amoxicillin dosages caused faster bacterial reduction. The PAE analysis showed extended post-treatment bacterial suppression at elevated doses, particularly against S. aureus. Conclusions: Species-specific amoxicillin dosing strategies are necessary due to differing resistance and susceptibility profiles between S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius. High-dose amoxicillin therapy is recommended to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes for resistant SA, while slightly adjusted dosing can manage S. pseudintermedius infections.

39858347,2025,"BACKGROUND: Thermophilic Campylobacter species are among the main culprits behind bacterial gastroenteritis globally and have grown progressively resistant to clinically important antimicrobials. Many studies have been carried out to explore innovative and alternative strategies to control antibiotic-resistant campylobacters in animal reservoirs and human hosts; however, limited studies have been performed to develop efficient control schemes against Campylobacter biofilms. METHODS: This study investigated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of some herbal extracts against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Campylobacter species recovered from different sources using phenotypic and molecular techniques. RESULTS: The overall Campylobacter species prevalence was 21.5%, representing 15.25% and 6.25% for C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively. Regarding C. jejuni, the highest resistance rate was observed for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and colistin (85.25% each), followed by cefotaxime (83.61%) and tetracycline (81.97%), whereas C. coli isolates showed absolute resistance to cefotaxime followed by erythromycin (92%) and colistin (88%). Remarkably, all Campylobacter isolates were MDR with elevated multiple antimicrobial resistance (MAR) indices (0.54-1). The antimicrobial potentials of green tea (Camellia sinensis), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and ginger (Zingiber officinale) extracts against MDR Campylobacter isolates were assessed by the disk diffusion assay and broth microdilution technique. Green tea extract showed a marked inhibitory effect against tested isolates, exhibiting growth inhibition zone diameters of 8 to 38 mm and a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 1.56-3.12 mg/mL, unlike the rosemary and ginger extracts. Our findings reveal a respectable antibiofilm activity (>50% biofilm formation inhibition) of green tea against the preformed biofilms of Campylobacter isolates. Furthermore, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the expression levels of biofilm biosynthesis gene and its regulator (FlaA and LuxS, respectively) in Campylobacter isolates treated with the green tea extract in comparison with untreated ones. CONCLUSION: This is the first in vitro approach that has documented the inhibitory activity of green tea extract against MDR-biofilm-producing Campylobacter species isolated from different sources. Further in vivo studies in animals' models should be performed to provide evidence of concept for the implementation of this alternative candidate for the mitigation of MDR Campylobacter infections in the future.","[('bacterial gastroenteritis', 'DISEASE'), ('campylobacters', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colistin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colistin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('green tea', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ginger', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Green tea extract', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ginger', 'CHEMICAL'), ('green tea', 'CHEMICAL'), ('FlaA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('green tea extract', 'CHEMICAL'), ('green tea extract', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Campylobacter infections', 'DISEASE')]"

To address this gap, a study was conducted in Germany to analyze patterns of antibiotic use in dogs and cats. Methods: Antibiotic usage data were obtained from debevet, a cloud-based veterinary practice management software based in Berlin, Germany. Practices with fewer than 100 patients were excluded, and data from 2018 to 2022 were analyzed. Results: The analysis included 477,310 consultations of 78,381 dogs and 241,532 consultations of 55,729 cats across 133 veterinary practices. Antibiotics were used in 12.9% of dog consultations and 22.5% of cat consultations, with substantial variation across practices. Aminopenicillins, particularly amoxicillin, were the most commonly used antibiotics, while the highest-priority critically important antibiotics (HPCIAs) accounted for 12.4% of treatments. Follow-up treatments led to changes in antibiotic substances in 9.3% of cases, often within the first two days. Indications varied by species, with respiratory issues more frequent in cats and orthopedic problems in dogs. Body weight and breed characteristics influenced the likelihood of antibiotic treatment, with short-nosed breeds showing higher odds. Conclusions: The routine data analysis provided valuable insights into antibiotic use in dogs and cats, enabling tracking trends across species and indications over time. While some specific information was missing, the invoicing data's completeness, the cost-effectiveness of their use, and their unbiased nature make them a robust tool for monitoring and informing legislative changes.","[('Aminopenicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

We used snowball and convenient sampling methods for recruiting dentists. Categorical data were described as absolute numbers and percentages. Differences in the use of antibiotics for specific health conditions were analyzed using Chi-Square, with p < 0.05. Results: Overall, 74 dentists completed the survey. The dentists used antibiotics either before and after (N = 37, 48.7%), before (N = 21; 27.6%), or after dental implant placement (N = 17, 22.4%).

According to the WHO AWaRe classification, ampicillin (ACCESS group) had the highest resistance, while nitrofurantoin had the lowest across all samples. The WATCH group antibiotics, cefuroxime and cefoxitin, showed comparable resistance levels, whereas aztreonam from the RESERVE group (tested only in wastewater) was 100% sensitive. Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index analysis revealed that 7% of wastewater and 38.2% of clinical samples had MAR values over 0.2, indicating prior antibiotic exposure in clinical isolates. These parallel patterns in wastewater and clinical samples highlight wastewater monitoring as a valuable tool for AMR surveillance, supporting antibiotic stewardship through ongoing environmental and clinical assessment.","[('CIA', 'DISEASE'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nalidixic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefoxitin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aztreonam', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39856742,2025,"BACKGROUND: The evolving infant gut microbiome influences host immune development and later health outcomes. Early antibiotic exposure could impact microbiome development and contribute to poor outcomes. Here, we use a prospective longitudinal birth cohort of n = 323 healthy term African American children to determine the association between antibiotic exposure and the gut microbiome through shotgun metagenomics sequencing as well as bile acid profiles through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Stool samples were collected at ages 4, 12, and 24 months for antibiotic-exposed (n = 170) and unexposed (n = 153) participants. A short-term substudy (n = 39) collected stool samples at first exposure, and over 3 weeks following antibiotics initiation. Antibiotic exposure (predominantly amoxicillin) was associated with minimal microbiome differences, whereas all tested taxa were modified by breastfeeding. In the short-term substudy, we observed microbiome differences only in the first 2 weeks following antibiotics initiation, mainly a decrease in Bifidobacterium bifidum. The differences did not persist a month after antibiotic exposure. Four species were associated with infant age. Antibiotic exposure was not associated with an increase in antibiotic resistance gene abundance or with differences in microbiome-derived fecal bile acid composition. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term and long-term gut microbiome perturbations by antibiotic exposure were detectable but substantially smaller than those associated with breastfeeding and infant age.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Bifidobacterium', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39856593,2025,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance remains a worldwide health problem with serious societal and economical repercussions. Multidrug resistant and Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase producing-Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) are pathogens of critical public health priority that urgently require the research and development of new drugs. This study aims to determine the prevalence and characterize the genes conferring resistance to beta-lactams among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the West region, Cameroon. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among two healthcare facilities during a four-month period from February to May, 2023. All mid-stream urine samples were collected from UTIs patients. The Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae strains were identified using Enterosystem 18R kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The screening of ESBL production was done using ESBL ChromAgar medium combined with the double-disk synergy test (DDT). Antimicrobial resistance genes were detected using polymerase chain methods. The data analysis was performed using Excel 2016 and IBM SPSS version 20. RESULTS: A total of 215 urine samples were collected and analyzed during the study period. A 31.62% (68/215) prevalence of Enterobacterales was detected with prevalence of 79.41% (54/68) and 14.70% (10/68) for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. The overall prevalence of ESBL-Enterobacterales was 64.70% (44/68). About 82% (36/44) of isolates were MDR and high resistance level was observed for amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and ceftazidime. The resistance genes detected were bla(CTX-M), and bla(TEM) respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study highlight the high burden of MDR and ESBL-E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates from UTIs. The study emphasizes the necessity of routine screening and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare facilities and community settings. It is therefore crucial to implement antimicrobial stewardship programs in the country and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in hospital settings.","[('pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('18R', 'CHEMICAL'), ('44/68', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MDR', 'DISEASE'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MDR', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('IPC', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Therefore, it is important for clinicians to understand the diversity and the antibiotic resistance of subgingival microbiota when exposed to different antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, subgingival plaques were collected from 10 periodontitis patients and 11 periodontally healthy volunteers, and their microbiota response to selective pressure of four antibiotics (amoxicillin, metronidazole, clindamycin, and tetracycline) were evaluated through 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing analysis. Additionally, sensitive and resistant strains were isolated and cultured in vitro for resistance evaluation. RESULTS: Cultivation of subgingival microbiota revealed the oral microbiota from periodontitis patients were more resistant to antibiotics than that of healthy. Significant differences were also observed for the microbial community between with and without antibiotics (especially amoxicillin and tetracycline) treated in periodontitis group. CONCLUSION: Overall, after the two antibiotics (amoxicillin and tetracycline) exposed, the oral subgingival microbiota in periodontitis patients exhibited different diversity and composition.

39840936,2025,"IntroductionAlthough marine envenomations are a reason for consultation in tropical emergency departments, stonefish stings are particularly feared. Immediate management focuses on pain control, whereas late management addresses cutaneous complications. This study presents a new series and compares the management of these patients and their outcomes at our center over the past 20 years.MethodsThis study presents a new series of 53 patients treated between 2016 and 2020 at the South Hospital of the University Hospital Center of Reunion following a sting attributed to the stonefish. We compared this new series with a previous series of patients treated at the same center for the same reason between 2001 and 2005.ResultsThe series are comparable. Regarding early management, the use of regional anesthesia was more frequent (47 vs 3.5%). Half the patients received a strong opioid. Prescription of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids persisted. Exposure to a heat source remained common. Prophylactic antibiotics were prescribed more frequently (64 vs 35%) and more uniformly with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Regarding late management, the average duration of hospitalization decreased (1.8 vs 2.6 d). Cutaneous complications were less frequent (9 vs 25%). No patient managed with regional anesthesia presented cutaneous complications.ConclusionsThe management of patients in Reunion following Scorpaenidae stings has evolved over time. Regional anesthesia has become more widespread, and the prescription of probabilistic preventive antibiotic therapy is more homogeneous. These changes are associated with a shorter hospital stay and fewer cutaneous complications.","[('marine envenomations', 'DISEASE'), ('stings', 'DISEASE'), ('pain', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39840184,2024,"Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is characterized by episodic vasospasm of the small blood vessels, primarily affecting the fingers and toes. Management includes lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, and in severe cases, surgical interventions. Here we report a case of an 80-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and atrial fibrillation who presented to the emergency department with edema, cyanosis, and intense pain in the fingers of both hands following a mild COVID-19 infection (no dyspnea or hypoxemia). Despite stable vital signs and an otherwise unremarkable physical exam, laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers, and signs of local infection. Consequently, he was admitted to the ward on antibiotics (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), nifedipine for vasodilation, and opioids for pain control. However, his condition deteriorated, with progressive necrosis necessitating escalation of therapy to iloprost infusion and bosentan. The right hand showed no improvement, and surgical intervention was planned around wound care aimed at mummification and subsequent amputation. The left hand gradually improved with continued medication. During hospitalization, serologic testing and nailfold capillaroscopy did not reveal any secondary causes such as connective tissue diseases. Imaging studies ruled out underlying neoplasia and thrombosis. The patient was diagnosed with severe Raynaud's phenomenon, potentially triggered by the recent COVID-19 infection, a phenomenon already described in case reports. This case underscores the potential impact of COVID-19 as a precipitating factor for severe Raynaud's phenomenon, particularly in elderly patients with comorbidities.

39839362,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze antimicrobial prescribing practices in Australian emergency departments (ED), identifying prescribing areas requiring improvement. This aims to inform antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) strategies to enhance antimicrobial prescribing quality. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the Hospital National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey (NAPS) data set. SETTING: EDs in public and private Australian hospitals (n = 652). PARTICIPANTS: Hospitals (n = 652) that participated in the Hospital NAPS from 2013 to 2022. METHODS: Data were collected by trained auditors from participating hospitals with the use of a standardized auditing tool, the Hospital NAPS. Data from 2013 to 2022 were analyzed descriptively. Variables assessed included guideline compliance and appropriateness by antimicrobial and indication, and reasons for inappropriateness. RESULTS: There were 3,098 antimicrobial prescriptions from EDs included for analysis. Guideline compliance (63.5%) and appropriateness (70.4%) in EDs were lower compared to overall prescribing practices from all departments. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobial was ceftriaxone (16.9%, n = 523), and the most common indication was empiric prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia (16.0%, n = 497). Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (53.2%, n = 99), and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (54.3%, n = 57), were the antimicrobial and indication with the lowest rates of appropriateness respectively. Ceftriaxone prescribing also had a low rate of appropriateness (62.3%, n = 326). Selection of antimicrobials with too broad of a spectrum was the most common reason for inappropriateness (40.2%).

Therefore, comprehending the effects of commonly used antibiotic therapy on the gut microbiota and butyrate-producers in early infants could provide information for therapeutic decision-making in the NICU. OBJECTIVES: To explore the effects of antibiotic therapy on the early development of gut microbiota and butyrate-producers in early infants. METHODS: A total of 72 infants were included in the study. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing on stool swab samples collected from neonatal intensive care unit patients who received amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AC, n = 10), moxalactam (ML, n = 28) and non-antibiotics (NA, n = 34). We then compared the taxonomic composition between treatment regimens, focusing on differences in butyrate-producers. RESULTS: Our study showed that there were significant differences in Shannon index (p = 0.033) and Beta diversity (p = 0.014) among the three groups. At the family level, compared with the other two groups, the relative abundance of Clostridiaceae (p < 0.001) and Veillonellaceae (p = 0.004) were significantly higher, while the relative abundance of Enterococcidae (p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the NA group. The relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (p = 0.022) in the AC group was greater than that in the other two groups. Additionally, butyrate-producers (p < 0.001), especially Clostridiaceae (p < 0.001), were noticeably more abundant in the NA group. The relative abundance of Clostridiaceae and butyrate-producers were the lowest in the ML group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We found that antibiotic therapy had an adverse impact on the initial development of gut microbiota and leaded to a reduction in the abundance of butyrate-producers, particularly Clostridiaceae. Furthermore, moxalactam had a more pronounced effect on the gut microbiota compared to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.","[('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('moxalactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('moxalactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39839106,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Glaesserella parasuis causes Glasser's disease in pigs, a leading cause of death in swine herds and a major contributor to economic losses in the global swine industry. Although several studies have investigated antimicrobial resistance in G. parasuis, the correlation between phenotypic and genotypic resistance remains unclear due to incomplete genetic resistance mechanisms detection. METHODS: The susceptibility of 117 clinical G. parasuis isolates to 7 antimicrobials was determined using a broth microdilution method. The sequences of 48 resistant isolates were obtained by whole-genome sequencing. Resistance genes, mutations, and group 1 vtaAs were detected based on whole-genome sequence data. Sequence types (STs) were identified by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: Phenotypic analysis showed that most isolates were susceptible to the tested antibiotics; resistance was most common against tetracycline (27%) and enrofloxacin (20%). All isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur. Analysis of whole-genome sequences revealed that resistance to tetracycline, amoxicillin, erythromycin, florfenicol, and chloramphenicol was frequently associated with the resistance genes tet(B) or tet(H), bla (ROB-1) , erm(T), floR, and catA3, and enrofloxacin resistance was associated with mutations in GyrA, ParC, and ParE. MLST identified 25 STs, of which, 14 were novel. The sequenced strains were divided into two primary lineages, LI and LII. Group 1 vtaA genes were detected in 87.5% (n = 42) of the isolates. CONCLUSION: This study provides comprehensive insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for drug resistance in G. parasuis, the characteristics of molecular epidemiology, and the virulence of resistant groups. Our findings can aid in the development of G. parasuis-specific clinical breakpoints and inform strategies for managing antimicrobial resistance in swine herds.","[('death', 'DISEASE'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('enrofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftiofur', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('florfenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chloramphenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erm(T', 'DISEASE'), ('catA3', 'CHEMICAL'), ('enrofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ParC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('LI', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39837366,2025,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the impact of introducing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) ward rounds. METHODS: We used an interrupted time-series approach to investigate the impact of implementing AMS ward rounds with in-person feedback from a multidisciplinary team in Hospital-1, also comparing to Hospital-2 in the same city where AMS ward rounds were not yet implemented. Regression models were used to identify predictors of advice given and of whether advice was followed, and associations between advice uptake and length of stay. RESULTS: Introducing AMS ward rounds was followed by new or accelerated declines in ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam use at Hospital-1. Except for ceftriaxone, similar declines were not seen at Hospital-2. Half of reviews (3471/6878; 50%) recommended an intervention; 2003/2726 (73%) subsequently evaluated recommendations were implemented. Senior doctors were more likely than pharmacists or specialist doctors in training to recommend de-escalation/stopping antibiotics and to have their advice followed. The more prior AMS reviews completed, the more likely advice was to be followed. Following advice to de-escalate/stop antimicrobials was associated with a 0.58 day [95%CI 0.22-0.94] reduction in hospital stay.

39837021,2025,"Antibiotics are commonly used in pig farming to control infections caused by diarrhea-causing Escherichia coli (E. coli). However, improper or excessive use of antibiotics in pigs can enhance antibiotic resistance (ABR). This study used bacteriophage (phage) treatment to control ABR E. coli in diarrheal suckling piglets. Fifty E. coli isolates were previously isolated from suckling pigs, which showed resistance to amoxicillin (100 %), oxytetracycline and neomycin (94 %), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (70 %), gentamicin (56 %), cephalexin (54 %), enrofloxacin (42 %), and colistin (28 %). Five phages (WPEC1, WPEC2, WPEC3, WPEC4, and WPEC5) were included in this study. These phages showed a diverse lytic profile ranging from 46.0 % to 64.0 % on the tested ABR E. coli isolates. The phage cocktail reduced the count of five representative E. coli by showing up to 8 log-units reduction (p < 0.05) after phage treatment for 6-24 h.

The research further seeks to evaluate the antibiotic resistance patterns of the identified bacterial isolates. METHODS: 84 paper currency notes and 56 coins were collected from seven different sources. Bacterial contamination was assessed using standard bacteriological and biochemical tests to identify and characterize the bacteria. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated strains was evaluated using an antibiogram study. RESULTS: A total of 368 bacterial isolates were detected across the sampled currency, with 99% of the currency samples contaminated by bacteria. Paper currency exhibited a higher prevalence of contamination compared to coins. Gram-staining revealed 20% Gram-positive and 80% Gram-negative bacteria on notes, compared to 38% Gram-positive and 62% Gram-negative bacteria on coins. Bacterial contamination was most frequent in samples from fish sellers, followed by poultry sellers, fruit sellers, and restaurants. The most commonly identified bacteria were Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella aerogenes. Antibiotic resistance testing revealed that all isolates were 100% resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, and penicillin G, while showing 100% sensitivity to azithromycin and gentamycin. Notably, 70.8% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, and 75% showed resistance to cefotaxime.

Recent research emphasizes culture-independent molecular sequencing to identify clusters of flora that may function as drivers of inflammation. Studies also indicate that macrolides are as effective as corticosteroids in controlling chronic rhinosinusitis. In this study, we aimed to isolate microbial cultures from the middle meatus of patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis and assess the isolates for similarities and antibiotic sensitivity. We also sought to identify the pathogenic species disrupting the nasal microbiome and provide appropriate antibiotics based on the least minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) from the cultures. Disease progression and response to treatment were evaluated using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) and the Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scoring system. Specifically, diagnostic nasal endoscopy (DNE) was performed in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSnNP), and the pre-treatment Lund-Kennedy score was recorded, along with subjective data collected from the SNOT-22 questionnaire. After isolating cultures from the middle meatus, antibiotic treatment was provided based on these findings. A repeat DNE was conducted to calculate the post-treatment Lund-Kennedy score and collect the post-treatment SNOT-22 score. Finally, the pre- and post-treatment scores were compared to assess any statistically significant differences. Methods The patients upon arrival to the hospital and diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (CRSnNP) based on the joint EPOS 2020 Criterion for the same were enrolled in the study. The patients were administered an SNOT-22 Questionnaire for subjective evaluation. The patients underwent a diagnostic nasal endoscopy (DNE) to calculate the Lund-Kennedy score, take swabs from the middle meatus for culture and sensitivity, and provide objective evaluation by the assessing physicians. The scores were recorded at the first visit and on each visit till the two weeks of antibiotic treatment were completed. The patients were treated with antibiotics as per the cultured isolates. The Lund-Kennedy scores and SNOT-22 scores before and after treatment were compared to note the response to treatment. Results The mean average Lund-Kennedy score and SNOT-22 scores dropped following a course of antibiotics. The patients also experienced symptomatic relief. The most commonly isolated organism among the samples evaluated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The best response to antibiotics was noted with aminoglycosides. Total resistance (100%) to macrolides and amoxicillin was also observed, which contradicts the antibiotic guidelines of EPOS 2020, ICAR 2021, and JTFPP 2014. Conclusion This study found that the invasive species disrupting the local nasal microbiome of the participants consisted of various pathogenic microorganisms.

39834420,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Contamination of drinking water by Helicobacter pylori can cause serious diseases, including cancer. The determinants of the infection rate are socioeconomic status, low standard of living and overcrowding. In addition, exposure to environmental sources contaminated with feces, such as water and vegetables, is another risk factor for infection. We analyzed the occurrence of H. pylori in drinking water sources and the antimicrobial resistance profile in central Peru. METHODS: Water samples were collected from taps in four provinces of the Junin region. Previously, biofilm sampling was performed from the internal surface of the taps. The samples were cultured on modified brain heart infusion blood agar at 37  degrees C under microaerophilic conditions for seven days. Antibiotic sensitivity of H. pylori was determined by the Kirby Bauer diffusion method. RESULTS: The results revealed that pH (9.25) and turbidity (5.15 NTU) exceeded the Peruvian environmental quality standards for drinking water. The amount of free chlorine residual in the H. pylori positive water samples ranged from 0.02 to 0.12 mg/L. H. pylori was present in 2/192 tap water samples (1.04 %) and in 3/192 tap biofilm samples (1.56 %). It was observed that 100 % of H. pylori isolates from water samples from the Chilca district showed resistance to nalidixic acid and 66.67 % to both amoxicillin and chloramphenicol. Resistance to nalidixic acid of H. pylori isolates obtained from biofilm samples from taps in the El Tambo district ranged from 66.67 % to 100 %. CONCLUSION: The study findings reveal that water samples and tap biofilms in the Chilca, El Tambo and Huamancaca chico districts in the Junin region harbor H. pylori. They also reveal variability in the pattern of resistance to more than one antibiotic tested from one district to another.","[('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('chlorine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nalidixic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chloramphenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nalidixic acid', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39833745,2025,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines suggest treating fully penicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains causing infective endocarditis with amoxicillin combined with gentamicin or ceftriaxone, but clinical evidence to support this practice is limited and monotherapy cohorts were excluded from studies. We describe antibiotic treatment, complications, and outcomes in patients with Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis, specifically comparing monotherapy versus combination therapy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected cohort of patients with definite or possible infective endocarditis from 2 English centres between 2006 and 2021. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury, relapse, and clinical cure. RESULTS: 178 individuals were included: median age was 72 years (interquartile range 60-79), male sex majority (138, 78%) and mostly native valve endocarditis (108, 61%). Thirty-nine patients (22%) received monotherapy (penicillin/glycopeptide/linezolid/daptomycin), 128 (72%) combination with gentamicin, 11 (6%) combination with ceftriaxone. Patients on combination therapy with gentamicin had a statistically significant lower 30-day mortality than those treated with monotherapy (21 (16.4%) versus 15 (38.5%) p = 0.035) and higher rates of clinical cure (101 (78.9%) versus 23 (59.0%) p = 0.018). Patient receiving gentamicin were more likely to experience acute kidney injury (64 (50%) versus 11 (28.2%) p = 0.057). Ceftriaxone combination was associated with poor outcomes, but the sample size was small. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with combination gentamicin therapy had better clinical outcomes than patients treated with monotherapy. Low-dose gentamicin regimens were associated with acute kidney injury. Patients treated with combinations were different to those treated with monotherapy and confounding remains a concern with observational analyses.

Drug-resistant diseases cause numerous deaths globally a year, and antibiotic stewardship is a cornerstone in fighting antibiotic resistance. This study focuses on tracking the antibiotic prescribing practices in Palestine and improving future antibiotic prescribing. METHODOLOGY: Data from prescriptions of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics was collected from the Health Department of Ramallah and Al-Bireh clinics between January 1 to March 31, 2020. The prescriptions were divided into three categories according to the diagnosis status: unwritten, unspecific, and precise diagnosis. The precise prescriptions were further divided into two categories: appropriate or inappropriate indication. Only appropriate prescriptions were candidates for the assessment of dose and duration appropriateness. RESULTS: The percentages of the three categories of diagnosis precise, unspecific, and unwritten were 23.4%, 20.4%, and 56.2%, respectively. The percentage of appropriate prescriptions was 16.2%. Azithromycin was the most over-utilized antibiotic, followed by co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid). Amoxicillin and co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) were under-prescribed. All the prescriptions indicated for urinary tract infections (UTIs) were inappropriate. CONCLUSIONS: Most prescriptions were not candidates for analysis due to missing diagnosis. Amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefuroxime, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics and were mostly indicated for pharyngitis. The duration of all sinusitis regimens was inappropriate.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and multi-drug resistant (MDR) profiles of MRSA in goats in Bangladesh. METHODOLOGY: A total of 150 samples from goats comprised of rectal swab (n = 50), nasal swab (n = 50), and milk (n = 50) were collected. Isolation of S. aureus from samples was conducted onto mannitol salt agar (MSA). Identification of S. aureus was performed by cultural characteristics, Gram staining, biochemical tests (catalase, coagulase, indole, methyl red, and Voges-Proskaur), and nuc gene-specific PCR assay. The MRSA was identified by cefoxitin disc diffusion test and mecA gene-specific PCR assay. The MDR profiles of MRSA were performed against ampicillin, amoxicillin, gentamicin, cefoxitin, vancomycin, azithromycin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid by disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of S. aureus was 35.3% and MRSA was 7.3%. The prevalence of MRSA was 12% in rectal swabs, 8% in nasal swabs, and 2% in milk. The highest resistance of MRSA was against ampicillin (91%) followed by azithromycin (55%), amoxycillin (36%), nalidixic acid (27%), ciprofloxacin (18%) and cefotaxime (9%).

39823615,2025,"Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102 degrees F (39 degrees C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages. Antibiotics should be considered for patients with 3 or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after 3 to 5 days of symptoms, or 7 or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available. Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limited, lasting 7 to 10 days. Complications of rhinosinusitis are rare but may include orbital cellulitis, meningitis, and abscess.

METHODS: Pilot online survey of Atlanta area and National Community Pharmacists Association pharmacists or pharmacy technicians that self-reported dispensing amoxicillin suspension. Questions regarding liquid amoxicillin dispensing practices and other open comments were asked about suggestions to decrease amoxicillin waste from March 13 to April 5, 2023. RESULTS: Among 68 pharmacy staff that participated, over 90% reported dispensing extra liquid amoxicillin to patients for more than 10% of the doses they dispensed. Twenty-seven respondents (39.7%) felt that amoxicillin waste was a problem; waste was most often due to package/bottle sizing issues (n = 64 of 67 responses, 95.5%). Respondents reported instructing families to dispose of extra medication in the trash (n = 51, 75%); 11 (16.2%) instructed pour the remaining in the sink; none reported requesting return to the pharmacy, and 6 (8.8%) reported other instructions.

We report a rare case of a massive polymicrobial shoulder abscess developing two decades after an insect bite, emphasizing its clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and surgical management. A 65-year-old female presented with severe, progressively worsening right shoulder pain, a 20 cm swelling, and purulent discharge persisting for 15 days. Her medical history revealed hypertension, diabetes, and intermittent swelling in the insect-bitten region over the years, which likely predisposed the area to recurrent infections. No evidence of autoimmune disorders, corticosteroid use, or dental abscess was identified. Clinical examination revealed a purulent yellow discharge from the superolateral region of the right shoulder. Ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced MRI confirmed a localized subcutaneous abscess without muscle invasion. The surgical intervention included open irrigation and debridement, revealing dense, purulent, caseous, malodorous material with necrotic debris. Microbiological analysis identified anaerobic streptococci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, anaerobic non-spore-forming gram-positive rods, Corynebacterium species, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with no evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The pathogens were sensitive to ampicillin-sulbactam. The patient underwent a 10-day intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam regimen, followed by a one-month course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The deep wound cavity was managed with vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy for ten sessions, significantly aiding recovery. Complete healing with restored shoulder mobility was achieved. This case highlights the importance of considering unusual etiologies, such as delayed complications from insect bites, in shoulder abscesses. The patient's history of intermittent swelling in the affected area likely predisposed it to infection. Prompt surgical intervention, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and advanced wound care techniques, including VAC therapy, were pivotal in achieving successful outcomes.

METHODS: We performed 20 repeated ASTs for seven clinical E. coli isolates: Two resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam but susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, four isolates with various beta-lactamase coding genes (two bla(TEM-1), one bla(OXA-1), and one with plasmidal bla(ampC)), and one isolate where VITEK 2 initially could not produce MIC measurements for piperacillin/tazobactam (i.e. no results generated). RESULTS: Upon repetition, the same MIC as the mode value (i.e. the most frequent MIC value of each AST method) was found between 21% and 87% (BMD), 46% and 100% (VITEK 2), and 48% and 100% (gradient test) of the repetitions. The range of essential agreement percentage (i.e. +/-1 doubling dilution from this mode value) was 53-100% (BMD), 63-100% (VITEK 2), and 100% (gradient test).

39816483,2025,"The emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms has made antimicrobial resistance a global issue, and milk is a potential source for the propagation of resistant bacteria causing zoonotic diseases. Subclinical mastitis (SCM) cases, often overlooked and mixed with normal milk in dairy farms, frequently involve E. coli, which can spread through contaminated milk. We conducted this study to determine the prevalence of virulence genes, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), antimicrobial susceptibility, and the genetic relatedness of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) isolated from SCM milk. SCM-positive bovine milk was subjected to E. coli detection using cultural, biochemical, and molecular methods. Further, we detected STEC virulence genes including stx1, stx2, and eaeA. STEC isolates were tested for ARGs including blaSHV, CITM, tetA, and aac(3)-IV, and underwent antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Moreover, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the stx1 gene of MDR-STEC. SCM was detected in 47.2% of milk samples of which 50.54% were E. coli positive. About 17.20% of E. coli isolates contained STEC virulence genes, and stx2 was the most prevalent. Moreover, all STEC isolates harbored at least one of the ARGs, while about 43.75% of the isolates carried multiple ARGs. Additionally, all the STEC isolates showed multidrug resistance, and were found to be fully resistant against amoxicillin, followed by ampicillin (87.50%) and gentamycin (75%); and were mostly sensitive to aztreonam (81.25%) and meropenem (68.75%). In phylogeny analysis, the stx1 gene of isolated MDR-STEC showed close relatedness with disease-causing non-O157 and O157 strains of different sources including cattle, humans, and food.","[('mastitis', 'DISEASE'), ('STEC', 'DISEASE'), ('STEC', 'DISEASE'), ('stx2', 'DISEASE'), ('STEC', 'DISEASE'), ('SCM', 'CHEMICAL'), ('STEC', 'DISEASE'), ('stx2', 'DISEASE'), ('STEC', 'DISEASE'), ('STEC', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aztreonam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39816335,2024,"Subclinical mastitis (SCM), a silent threat in the dairy sector of Bangladesh poses a significant economic impact and serves as a potential source of infection for healthy cows, hindering efforts to achieve milk self-sufficiency. Despite the importance of this issue, limited research has been conducted on mastitis in Sylhet region of Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the molecular prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and resistant genes detection on pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) causing SCM. In a cross-sectional study utilizing convenience sampling, 325 milk samples were collected from apparently healthy dairy cows. Initially, SCM was detected using the modified Whiteside test (MWST) method. Suspected positive samples were then subjected to bacteriological culture and standard biochemical assays, followed by molecular identification through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Finally, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted on all PCR-positive samples using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar. In the Sylhet district, the prevalence of SCM was 64.92 % (211 out of 325) at the individual animal level and 82.69 % (43 out of 52) at the herd level. Among the SCM-positive animals, S . aureus was found in 31.75 % (67 out of 211) of cases, E . coli in 81.99 % (173 out of 211), and K . pneumoniae in 66.82 % (141 out of 211). K . pneumoniae had the highest prevalence at 60 % in Zakiganj, S . aureus at 45 % in Zakiganj, and E . coli at 72 % in Bishwanath Upazila. Extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) genes bla (TEM) , bla (OXA), bla (CTX-M1,) bla (CTX-M2,) MultiCase (DHA) were identified. Additionally, antibiotic resistance genes tet(A), AAC (3)-iv, and Sul1 were also detected. The pathogens exhibited resistance to Penicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin), Cephems (cefuroxime, ceftazidime), and Tetracyclines (tetracycline). However, all three bacteria were highly sensitive to meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.

39816260,2024,"BACKGROUND: Childhood remains a vulnerable period and a key determiner for adult health. Various illnesses experienced by children in their early years determine future performance and contribution to society. Acute and chronic infectious diseases, undernutrition, and early childhood non-communicable diseases have greatly been linked to intellectual disability, poor childhood development, increased morbidity, and household and healthcare economic costs. In most developing countries, infections contribute to a larger burden of disease. Despite this being the case, most developing countries have a limited range of diagnostic capacity and access to a wide range spectrum of WHO Access, Watch and Reserve antibiotics. This leads to overuse and misuse of the available antibiotics and a wide range spread of resistance strains. In this study, we evaluated common childhood presentations and indications for antibiotic prescriptions at a community hospital in Malawi. OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed common childhood Clinical Presentations and antibiotic prescription patterns at the pediatric outpatient department (OPD) at St. Gabriel Community Mission Hospital in Malawi. METHODS: A retrospective search of all outpatient routinely corrected data from St. Gabriel Community Mission Hospital between January to December 2022 was carried out. Manual screening was done on all appropriate routines under 14 medical records, and prespecified variables were extracted. Data collected consisted of total OPD patient number, age, sex, diagnosis and prescription. RESULTS: A total of 2711 children under 15 years of age were included, with 53.9% being males. The majority of them were below the age of 5 (59.5%). 30% of the cases seen in the department were attributable to respiratory presentation, representing the majority of the cases seen. Sepsis and enteric diseases also constituted the majority of the cases seen and contributed 18% and 7% respectively. 68% per cent of the children seen during the period of the study had an antibiotic prescription, with the majority having only one antibiotic prescribed (31.7%). Overall, amoxicillin constituted the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for the whole system, while metronidazole was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic among enteric illnesses. Being under five was associated with a higher likelihood of antibiotic prescription (p <0.001). There were no significant differences in antibiotic prescription by gender and prescribing quarter of the year. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that there could be overuse and misuse of antibiotics within community hospitals. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics at the community level is closely linked to limited cytobacteriological testing, and limited access to all categories of antibiotics. Amid limited resources, more research is needed to understand the barriers and facilitators toward appropriate and inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions among primary healthcare workers. Furthermore, more training is needed on the use of validated antimicrobial treatment guidelines and point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests to improve rational antibiotic use.","[('chronic infectious diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('undernutrition', 'DISEASE'), ('non-communicable diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('intellectual disability', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('OPD', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Sepsis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39816247,2024,"INTRODUCTION: The intensification of tilapia production has increased animal density in tanks, leading to more frequent exposure to pathogenic agents and compromising the quality of fish products. Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern that affects human treatment, and sentinel microorganisms like Escherichia coli are crucial for monitoring production chains, especially in aquaculture, where research is still limited. The aim of this study was to identify the presence of E. coli and investigate its antimicrobial resistance profiles throughout the entire tilapia production chain. METHODS: A total of 240 samples were collected from various points in the production process: carcasses before scaling (Ca), scaling wastewater (Sw), filleting wastewater (Fw), fillet washing wastewater (Tw), fillet handling surfaces (Su), and pre-packaged fillets (Pf). The samples were collected during 10 visits, each corresponding to animals from different farms. E. coli isolates were identified using MacConkey agar and biochemical tests. Phenotypic resistance profiles were determined using nine classes of antimicrobials. Extended- spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production was identified with ceftazidime and cefotaxime and confirmed by a double-disc synergy test. Isolates were classified as sensitive or resistant based on the inhibition zone. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) was defined as resistance to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories, while extensively drug-resistant (XDR) was defined as resistance to at least one agent in all but two or fewer categories. RESULTS: Overall, 50.8% of the samples (122/240) tested positive for E. coli, with 403 isolates identified. Of these, 33% (133/403) were resistant to at least two antimicrobials, and 20% (48/240) of the samples had MDR isolates, with the highest frequency found at the filleting point (Fw), which also had the only XDR profile. Resistance was most commonly observed against amoxicillin (35.73%), tetracycline (30.77%), and ciprofloxacin (26.30%). DISCUSSION: These findings emphasize the importance of E. coli as an indicator of antimicrobial resistance throughout tilapia processing and highlight the need for good production practices and qualified technical support to mitigate risks to public health, animal health, and the environment.","[('Ca', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Pf', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('XDR', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Children in low-income nations have high carrier rates of Streptococcus pyogenes, which can serve as a source of infections, including simple superficial infections that may lead to invasive and post-streptococcal diseases, particularly among schoolchildren. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Streptococcus pyogenes, associated factors, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles among urban and rural public schoolchildren in Gondar City, Northwest Ethiopia. A school-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted via a multistage sampling technique among elementary schoolchildren from April to June 2022 in Gondar City. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected via a pretested structured questionnaire. Standard microbiological methods were used to collect and process throat swabs to isolate Streptococcus pyogenes. An antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed via the disk diffusion method. Epi-Info version 7.2.5 was used to enter the data, which were then exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the strength of associations between variables, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The overall prevalence of Streptococcus pyogenes in 438 children was 11.2% (n = 49), with 71.43% (35/49) being urban and 28.57% (14/49) being rural. Low-income parents, hospital admission history, and cigarette smoking in the home were found to be substantially linked with Streptococcus pyogenes carriage among students (p < 0.05). All the Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were susceptible (100%) to penicillin and cefotaxime, but 18.8% and 12.25% of the isolates were resistant to amoxicillin and tetracycline, respectively. The prevalence of Streptococcus pyogenes throat carriage among was intermediate. All the isolates were sensitive to penicillin and cefotaxime, but 18.8% and 12.25% of the isolates were resistant to amoxicillin and tetracycline, respectively. Thus, regular screening and surveillance of Streptococcus pyogenes among schoolchildren should be conducted to minimize carriage or infections and maintain the rational use of antimicrobials.

However, more than 90% of these patients can tolerate penicillin after appropriate evaluation. Penicillin is indicated for various issues that arise in pregnancy, and a history of allergy can have negative individual and public health consequences. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to prospectively evaluate the feasibility, safety, and select obstetric outcomes of obstetric penicillin allergy evaluations arranged through a direct referral phone line from obstetric practices to an employed allergy/immunology practice. METHODS: Patients were referred via direct phone line for evaluation during their antenatal visits between May 2019 and May 2022. Patients underwent skin prick testing, and those with a negative penicillin skin testing (PST) result were subjected to amoxicillin challenge. In select cases of patients with a low-risk history, direct oral challenge was performed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 324 patients referred between May 2019 and May 2022, a total of 251 (77.5%) presented for in-office evaluations. Of those 251 patients, 239 (95.2%) underwent PST followed by oral challenge if the PST result was negative; 12 patients (4.8%) underwent direct challenge without skin testing, and all of them passed the challenge. Of the patients undergoing PST, 230 (97.2%) had a negative result and 229 tolerated subsequent oral amoxicillin doses, with 1 patient experiencing a delayed reaction to the amoxicillin. The group of patients who presented for evaluation included more people living in ZIP codes described as being of high socioeconomic status than in the no-show group (73.7% vs 63.3%).

39808469,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic coccus capable of causing infectious diseases in animals and humans. Especially dangerous are multidrug-resistant forms with poor or even no response to available treatments. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to verify the effect of enzybiotics on the healing of S. aureus-infected skin wounds in an experimental pig model. METHODOLOGY: Two pigs were included in the experiment and wounds (10/pig) of 5 x 5 cm in size with 2 cm spacing were made by incision on their backs. The wounds were infected with a methicillin (oxacillin) and amoxicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus (MRSA). The experimental groups consisted of individual wounds that were infected with one sequence type of S. aureus at a concentration of 2 x 109 CFU/mL. Two wounds were left untreated (N), four wounds were using hydrogel with added lysostaphin, and four wounds were treated using hydrogel with added lysostaphin and endolysin. Subsequently, samples were taken from each wound on days 4, 7, 11, and 14. The material was processed using a standard histological technique of paraffin blocks and the sections were stained with hematoxylineosin. RESULTS: The results show that these defects present a full spectrum of reparative changes with re-epithelialization with alternating sections of necrosis and newly formed granulation tissue with an accompanying round cell inflammatory infiltrate in edematous tissue and surface scabs. On the surface of the wounds and also in smaller groups in the newly formed granulation tissue, coccoid formations corresponding to S. aureus are visible. Compared to untreated wounds, hydrogel dressings with added lysostaphin or lysostaphin and endolysin trapped greater numbers of S. aureus cocci colonies, which subsequently died off to a large extent.

39808467,2024,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at the University Hospital Olomouc (UHO) over a 10-year period (2013-2022). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data was obtained from the ENVIS LIMS laboratory information system (DS Soft, Czech Republic, Olomouc) of the Department of Microbiology, UHO, for the period 1/1/2013-31/12/2022. Standard microbiological procedures using the MALDI-TOF MS system (Biotyper Microflex, Bruker Daltonics) were applied for the identification. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the standard broth microdilution method according to EUCAST criteria. All Staphylococcus aureus strains were tested for methicillin resistance using selective diagnostic chromogenic media (ColorexTMMRSA, TRIOS) and an immunochromatographic test for PBP2a detection (PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test, AlereTM). Positive results were confirmed by mecA gene detection. Molecular typing to determine clonality/relatedness was performed on isolates from 2022 using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: The prevalence of MRSA at the UHO does not show an increasing trend and ranges between 3-6 %. The highest MRSA prevalence was detected in blood culture specimens (6 %), followed by lower respiratory tract specimens (5 %) and wound/abscess/aspirate specimens (5 %). The departments with the highest MRSA prevalence were the Geriatrics Department and the Second Internal Medicine Department. The antibiotic resistance patterns of MRSA were as follows: erythromycin 89 %, clindamycin 86 %, ciprofloxacin 80%, tetracycline 18 %, gentamicin 13 %, cotrimoxazole 7 %, and tigecycline 1 %. Resistance to antibiotics of choice for serious MRSA infections (vancomycin, ceftaroline, linezolid) was 0-1 %. Genetic analysis of selected MRSA isolates by PFGE revealed one cluster of five, two clusters of three, and two clusters of two isolates with indistinguishable restriction profiles. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MRSA at the UHO remains low, therefore oxacillin or possibly combined aminopenicillins (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ampicillin/sulbactam) or cefazolin can be relied upon for initial therapy of infections likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus.","[('methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cotrimoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tigecycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MRSA infections', 'DISEASE'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftaroline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('linezolid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminopenicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin/sulbactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefazolin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"

We selected the patients with a positive culture for F. magna. Risk factors for infection, patient's medical records, previous operation performed, time from surgical procedure to infection, susceptibility tests, antibiotic and surgical treatment for the infection, and recovery rate were registered for the analysis. Results: Twenty patients have positive cultures for F. magna, representing 15.5% of the anaerobic infections. Eleven of them were arthroplasties, three fracture synthesis, two foot operations, two spinal operations, and two soft tissue operations. All patients underwent operation and antibiotic treatment. The most commonly used antibiotic scheme was amoxicillin followed by amoxicillin-rifampicin.

39803560,2024,"Tuberculosis (TB) is historically the world's deadliest infectious disease. New TB drugs that can avoid pre-existing resistance are desperately needed. The beta-lactams are the oldest and most widely used class of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections but, for a variety of reasons, they were largely ignored until recently as a potential treatment option for TB. Recently, a growing body of evidence indicates that later-generation carbapenems in the presence of beta-lactamase inhibitors could play a role in TB treatment. However, most of these drugs can only be administered intravenously in the clinic. We performed a screening of beta-lactams against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and identified sanfetrinem cilexetil as a promising oral beta-lactam candidate. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that: (i) media composition impacts the activity of sanfetrinem against Mtb, being more potent in the presence of physiologically relevant cholesterol as the only carbon source, compared to the standard broth media; (ii) sanfetrinem shows broad spectrum activity against Mtb clinical isolates, including MDR/XDR strains; (iii) sanfetrinem is rapidly bactericidal in vitro against Mtb despite being poorly stable in the assay media; (iv) there are strong in vitro synergistic interactions with amoxicillin, ethambutol, rifampicin and rifapentine and, (v) sanfetrinem cilexetil is active in an in vivo model of infection. These data, together with robust pre-clinical and clinical studies of broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotics carried out in the 1990s by GSK, identified sanfetrinem as having potential for treating TB and catalyzed a repurposing proof-of-concept Phase 2a clinical study (NCT05388448) currently underway in South Africa.","[('Tuberculosis', 'DISEASE'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('deadliest infectious disease', 'DISEASE'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sanfetrinem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cholesterol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbon', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sanfetrinem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sanfetrinem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ethambutol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifapentine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('carbapenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sanfetrinem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TB', 'DISEASE'), ('NCT05388448', 'DISEASE')]"

Using the micro broth dilution method and the checkerboard dilution method, susceptibility tests were conducted on ten commonly used beta-lactam antibiotics against eleven strains of MRSA. It was found that cefquinome sulfate exhibits synergistic activity with PROs. The results indicate that among the ten antibiotics tested, five-potassium penicillin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, amoxicillin and CEFS had resistance rates exceeding 70%, indicating a serious resistance situation. Synergistic antibacterial effects showed that 25mug/mL of PROs could reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CEFS against MRSA strains from 8mug/mL to 1mug/mL, with a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.38+/-0.0, thus restoring the sensitivity of MRSA. These findings suggest the need for regular and continuous monitoring of the clinical distribution and resistance of MRSA in pig farms and implementing effective measures to prevent or control MRSA infections.","[('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefquinome', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('25mug/mL', 'CHEMICAL'), ('8mug/mL', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"
39799034,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Clear patient instructions are essential in pharmaceutical care. However, literature reveals a consistent gap between the readability of medication messages and population skills. This study aimed to assess the comprehension of information in three Prescription Medication Leaflets, with and without supplementary US Pharmacopeia (USP) pictograms, among Spanish adolescents completing secondary education. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial. From March to June 2022, 590 students were randomly assigned to read Prescription Medication Leaflets for ibuprofen, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and omeprazole, with or without USP pictograms. Comprehension was evaluated via questionnaire, alongside the European Health Literacy Survey short form, and sociodemographic data were collected. Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests were used for analysis. RESULTS: Participant comprehension was significantly below the European standard, which requires at least 80 % readability for Prescription Medication Leaflets, even with pictograms. Pictograms, however, significantly enhanced comprehension across all medication package inserts (p < 0.001 for all comparisons), especially among students with higher health literacy. High health literacy was a statistically significant factor in comprehension only within the experimental group (p = 0.005; p = 0.039; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The discouraging results highlight the imperative for innovation in medication labeling design, employing patient-centered approaches. USP pictograms have been shown to significantly enhance the reading comprehension of medication package inserts among the Spanish population.","[('ibuprofen', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('omeprazole', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Most pharmaceutical waste is disposed of with household waste, suggesting landfills are the most significant APIs contamination sources. We highlight the complex relationship between knowledge, risk perception, and behavioural intentions, stressing the relevance of risk perception as a mediator when studying how knowledge affects behaviour. Age and income are suggested to moderate risk perception and behavioural intention. There is a heavy use of over-the-counter and prescription drugs in UCRB, especially Paracetamol (426.1 tons/year) and Amoxicillin (343.7 tons/year). Measured herbal APIs highlight the cultural significance and dependence on traditional medicine.

39798106,2024,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of different endodontic irrigants employed in the lesion sterilization and tissue repair (LSTR) technique. METHODS: Forty children aged 4-8 years having at least one primary molar with irreversible pulpitis/pulpal necrosis indicated for pulpectomy were included. Participants were randomly divided into three test groups (Group A, B, and C) and one control group (Group D). After caries excavation using a spoon excavator, superficial pulp was removed under topical anesthesia in all groups. Following this, pulpal floor was irrigated using different endodontic irrigants in each group: Group A - 20% propolis, Group B - 2% sodium hypochlorite, Group C - 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and Group D (control) - saline. Alternate 3-Mix (triple antibiotic paste containing metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and amoxicillin) was then placed over the pulpal floor and the teeth were restored with glass ionomer cement followed by stainless steel crown. Patients were recalled at follow-up periods up to 18 months for clinical and radiographic evaluation. Repeated-measures ANOVA test, Chi-square test, and independent t-test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Clinical success was achieved in all treated teeth, with the results showing statistical significance (P < 0.05). In addition, Group C showed best clinical results. Statistically significant results (P < 0.05) were obtained in reduction in size of furcation radiolucency, with Group B showing the best results compared to other groups. Statistically significant results (P < 0.05) were obtained in terms of rate of root resorption in all teeth, with Group C showing least resorption compared to other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of endodontic irrigant before the placement of alternate 3-Mix is an effective step for the improved success of LSTR technique in primary teeth, with chlorhexidine showing the best success rate.","[('necrosis', 'DISEASE'), ('caries', 'DISEASE'), ('propolis', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sodium hypochlorite', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chlorhexidine gluconate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('LSTR', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chlorhexidine', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Recent studies have suggested associations between FT1DM and certain medications, warranting further investigation. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify drugs associated with an increased risk of FT1DM using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, evaluate reporting patterns, and provide actionable insights to reduce FT1DM occurrence and improve medication safety. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of FAERS data from 2013 to 2023 was conducted. Drug names were standardized using text mining tools, and safety signals were evaluated using reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS). RESULTS: A total of 706 FT1DM cases were identified, predominantly in older individuals and males. Nineteen drugs were implicated, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab), lenvatinib, eribulin, psychiatric drugs (atomoxetine, carbamazepine, lamotrigine), anti-infectives (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, amoxicillin), and metabolic modulators (dapagliflozin, sitagliptin, hydrochlorothiazide, allopurinol).

39795560,2024,"Background: Diabetic foot sepsis (DFS) is the leading cause of lower extremity amputations and timely initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy is paramount during its management. This study investigated causative microorganisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility profile in patients with DFS. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on patients who were 18-years and older admitted with DFS. Data collected included demographic information, comorbidities, clinical findings, types of specimens collected and results of microscopy, culture, and sensitivity (MC&S), treatment, and outcomes. Results: One hundred and sixty-eight records were found, of which 64.3% were of male patients. The median (IQR) age of males was 58 years (IQR 54-65) compared to 61 years (IQR 54-67) for females. Results of MC&S were available in 63.1% of the records, and E. faecalis was cultured in 16%, P. mirabilis in 10%, and S. aureus in 8% of cases. Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid was prescribed in 69% of the cases. Resistance to at least one antimicrobial was shown in 88% of S. aureus and 80% of P. mirabilis species. Conclusions: The commonly cultured organisms in patients with DFS were E. faecalis 16%, P. mirabilis 10%, and S. aureus. Amoxicillin/Clavulanic was prescribed empirically in 69% of the cases despite high rates of resistance, and in 37% treatment was not preceded by collection of specimens for MC&S. We therefore recommend collection of specimens for MC&S before initiation of antimicrobial therapy in all patients with DFS.","[('Diabetic foot sepsis', 'DISEASE'), ('lower extremity amputations', 'DISEASE'), ('mirabilis', 'DISEASE'), ('S. aureus', 'DISEASE')]"
39795411,2024,"Methyl gallate (MG), a natural phenolic compound, exhibits in vitro synergistic activity with amoxicillin (Amox) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a global health concern. This study developed electrospun nanofibers incorporating MG and Amox into a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/chitosan (CS) blend to target both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA. The formulation was optimized, and the impact of acetic acid on antibacterial activity was evaluated using agar disc diffusion. The final formulation was fabricated and characterized using SEM, FTIR, DSC, swelling, and release behavior analyses to understand its antibacterial efficacy. Results revealed that acetic acid eliminated antibacterial activity, but MG (64 mg/mL) and Amox (2.5 mg/mL) were successfully incorporated into a PVA/CS solution prepared with deionized water. The resulting nanofiber mats featured nanoscale fibers (126 +/- 45 nm) with and micron-oval beads. Despite the in vitro synergism, the MG/Amox/PVA/CS mats showed no significant improvement over MG or Amox alone against MRSA, likely due to their physicochemical properties. FTIR and DSC results confirmed molecular interactions between the active compounds and the polymer matrix, which may cause a minimal swelling and low drug release at 24 h.

Two months after his surgery, he had a new bacteremia due to Enterococcus faecalis and we discovered a pseudo-aneurysm of the mitro-aortic trigone. Our patient is treated medically at first, before benefiting from the ""Hemi-Commando"" procedure. DISCUSSION: The mitro-aortic trigone is a fibrous area, located between the left half of the noncoronary cusp and the left coronary cusp of the aortic valve and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve [1]. This area, important in the maintenance of mitral and aortic functions, [ii] is poorly vascularized and therefore very susceptible to infections and trauma [2]. Erosion of the aortic ring leads to the formation of a subvalvular abcess, secondarily detergated en then leads to the destruction of the trigone.

The efficacy was assessed by subjective clinical improvement and objective bacteriological cure at the end of treatment. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events during the study period. RESULTS: Co-amoxiclav, cefpodoxime proxetil, and levofloxacin showed comparable clinical responses on days three and seven; however, on day five, levofloxacin showed a significantly reduced cure rate, but a higher improvement rate, than co-amoxiclav and cefpodoxime proxetil. Bacteriologically, the responses were similar in all three groups at week 1. All drugs were well tolerated with a few self-limiting adverse effects.

However, quantifying the real-world impact of duration of therapy is hindered by bias common in observational studies. We aimed to evaluate the harms and benefits of longer versus shorter duration of therapy in older adults. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study using administrative health data from Ontario, Canada. We included outpatients aged 66-110 years who received a prescription for amoxicillin, cephalexin, and/or ciprofloxacin. Prescriptions were categorized as short (3-7 days) or long (8-14 days) duration. The primary outcome was a composite of antibiotic-related harms, including adverse reactions, Clostridioides difficile infection, and antibiotic resistance. The secondary outcome was a composite of safety measures including repeat antibiotic prescriptions, hospital visits, and mortality. To reduce risk of bias, we used an instrumental variable analysis where the instrument was prescriber proportion of antibiotics that were long duration. RESULTS: Among 117 682 eligible patients, there was no difference in the primary harms outcome for patients receiving longer versus shorter courses of antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval [CI]): amoxicillin, 0.99 (.84-1.15); cephalexin, 1.11 (.90-1.38); ciprofloxacin, 0.94 (.74-1.20).

39781149,2024,"The diagnostic process and discrimination of mucosal lesions present a formidable challenge for numerous clinicians, primarily attributable to the common overlap of clinical manifestations observed across various categories, including infectious, autoimmune, connective tissue, and systemic vascular inflammatory diseases. In cases of mucosal lesions, syphilis presents distinctive characteristics that can help clinicians differentiate it from other conditions. The most common manifestation of primary syphilis is mostly a painless, firm, indurated ulcer known as a chancre, which typically appears at the site of inoculation, with enlargement of regional lymph nodes. Sometimes, its painless course may be misleading. The objective of our study is to raise awareness of venereal diseases in cases of atypical oral mucosal lesions that do not respond to local treatment. A 32-year-old man was referred to the department of dermatology due to an enlarging, painful inflammatory lesion with central breakdown, covered with honey-yellow crusts on the lower lip.

39780928,2024,"We report a case of a woman presenting with an erythematous finger nodule, with a history of exposure to tropical fish. The erythematous nodules subsequently spread proximally from the finger. Initial treatment with oral amoxicillin-clavulanate was unsuccessful, and she developed a drug eruption. Treatment with oral minocycline and thermotherapy was initiated, as we suspected infection with Mycobacterium marinum (M. marinum) from her history and clinical features. A culture from a skin biopsy from the finger grew M. marinum, confirming the diagnosis. There is no established treatment regimen for skin infections caused by M. marinum. In this case, it took time for cultures to confirm the diagnosis of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. While it would be ideal to await culture results, we felt it was better for the patient to initiate treatment, and in M. marinum infections, minocycline is considered particularly effective. However, it was envisaged that this would result in a prolonged treatment course, leading to potential resistance. Thermotherapy was added in an attempt to shorten the treatment period. This regime was successful, and the patient has remained free of recurrence since. The early initiation of treatment for cutaneous non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection requires aggressive suspicion. Also, testing, including adequate sampling and culturing, is essential for an accurate diagnosis.

39779288,2025,"Oral antibiotic treatment is well known to be one of the main factors affecting gut microbiota composition by altering bacterial diversity. It decreases the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria such as Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, while increasing abundance of Enterobacteriaceae. The recovery time of commensal bacteria post-antibiotic treatment varies among individuals, and often, complete recovery is not achieved. Recently, gut microbiota disruption has been associated with increased gut oxygen levels and higher redox potential in faecal samples. Given that redox balance is crucial for microbial metabolism and gut health, influencing fermentation processes and maintaining anaerobic conditions, we investigated the impact of oral amoxicillin treatment on the redox potential in the caecum. We used 24 Wistar Han male rats and measured caecal redox potential in situ with a probe, before and after 7 days of amoxicillin treatment, as well as after 7 days of recovery. Additionally, we analysed caecal weight, pH, antioxidant capacity, caecal microbiota, metabolome, and colonic tissue expression of relevant genes involved in the redox potential state. Our findings show that oral amoxicillin treatment significantly reduced archaeal load, and decreased the bacterial alpha diversity and affected bacterial composition of the caecal microbiome. The caecal metabolome was also significantly affected, exemplified by reduced amounts of short chain fatty acids during amoxicillin treatment. While the caecal metabolome fully recovered 7 days post amoxicillin treatment, the microbiome did not fully recover within this time frame. However, amoxicillin did not lead to an increase in luminal redox potential in the cecum during or post amoxicillin treatment. Limited differences were observed for colonic expression of genes involved in intestinal barrier function and generation of reactive oxygen species, except for the catalase gene, which was significantly upregulated post-amoxicillin treatment.

39777248,2025,"BACKGROUND: A dual therapy regimen containing amoxicillin is a common treatment option for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). While substantial research supports the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan and amoxicillin (VA) dual therapy in the general population, there is still a lack of studies specifically focusing on its safety in elderly patients. AIM: To evaluate efficacy and safety of VA dual therapy as first-line or rescue treatment for H. pylori in elderly patients. METHODS: As a real-world retrospective study, data were collected from elderly patients aged 60 years and above who accepted VA dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily + amoxicillin 1000 mg thrice daily for 14 days) for H. pylori eradication in the Department of Gastroenterology at Peking University First Hospital between June 2020 and January 2024. H. pylori status was evaluated by (13)C-urease breath test 6 weeks after treatment. All adverse events (AEs) during treatment were recorded. RESULTS: In total, 401 cases were screened. Twenty-one cases were excluded due to loss to follow-up, lack of re-examination, or unwillingness to take medication. The total of 380 included cases comprised 250 who received VA dual therapy as first-line treatment and 130 who received VA dual therapy as rescue treatment. H. pylori was successfully eradicated in 239 cases (95.6%) in the first-line treatment group and 116 cases (89.2%) in the rescue treatment group. The overall incidence of AEs was 9.5% for both groups. Specifically, 9.2% of patients experienced an AE in the first-line treatment group and 10.0% in the rescue treatment group. Five patients discontinued treatment due to AE, with a discontinuation rate of 1.3%. No serious AE occurred. CONCLUSION: The VA dual therapy regimen as a first-line treatment and a rescue therapy was effective and safe for elderly patients aged 60 and older.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Helicobacter pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE')]"
39777230,2024,"Helicobacter pylori is a class I carcinogen that infects more than 100 million individuals in the United States. Antimicrobial therapy for H. pylori has typically been prescribed empirically rather than based on susceptibility testing. Until recently, therapeutic recommendations have generally ignored the principles of antibiotic stewardship. A combination of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (triple therapy) remains popular despite increasing clarithromycin resistance and poor cure rates. Concomitant therapy (a PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole) is recommended and widely used despite all patients receiving at least one unneeded antibiotic. In 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved vonoprazan, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin triple therapy, which administers unneeded clarithromycin to >90% of patients (i.e., ~6 tons of unneeded clarithromycin/million treatments). In the late 1980s, the infectious disease community functionally transferred responsibility for the management of H. pylori to gastroenterology, which has managed the infection as another common gastrointestinal disease such as constipation. In 2022, both traditional and noninvasive molecular-based susceptibility testing for H. pylori became available in the United States. In order to reduce and prevent antibiotic misuse, the infectious disease community should reclaim responsibility for the management of this important infectious disease.","[('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infectious disease', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('gastrointestinal disease', 'DISEASE'), ('constipation', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('infectious disease', 'DISEASE'), ('infectious disease', 'DISEASE')]"

39772461,2025,"Resistance by bacteria to available antibiotics is a threat to human health, which demands the development of new antibacterial agents. Considering the prevailing conditions, we have developed a library of new naphthalimide-coumarin moieties as broad-spectrum antibacterial agents to fight against awful drug resistance. Preliminary studies indicate that compounds 8e and 8h display excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, exceeding the performance of marketed drug amoxicillin. These drug candidates effectively inhibit biofilm formation and disrupt the biofilm virulence factor, which is accountable for the formation of strong biofilm. In addition to this, both compounds exhibit fast bactericidal properties, thus shortening the time of treatment and resisting the emergence of drug resistance for up to 20 passages. Further, biofunctional evaluation reveals that both compounds effectively disrupt the membrane, causing the leakage of cytoplasmic contents and loss in metabolic activity. Both compounds 8e and 8h efficiently induce the ROS, leading to the oxidation of GSH to GSSG, decreasing the GSH activity of the cell, and causing oxidative damage to the cells. Additionally, both compounds effectively bind with DNA to block DNA replication and form supramolecular complexes, thus exhibiting antibacterial activity. Moreover, these compounds readily bind human serum albumin with high binding constants and can be transported to the target site easily. These findings reveal that newly synthesized naphthalimide-coumarin conjugates have the potential to build as potent antibacterial agents and can be used further for clinical trials.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('GSH', 'CHEMICAL'), ('GSSG', 'CHEMICAL'), ('GSH', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Forty small-holder cow farms were randomly selected from eight cities/counties in six districts of Gansu Province, and a total of n = 530 lactating cows were included in this study. SCM prevalence was noted at 38.87% and 9.72% at the cow and quarter levels, respectively, based on the California Mastitis Test (CMT). The prevalence of the recovered bacterial species was noted as follows: S. agalactiae (36.02%), S. aureus (19.43%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (16.11%), S. dysgalactiae (12.80%), E. coli (9.00%), and S. uberis (6.64%). All isolated bacteria were 100% multi-drug-resistant (MDR) except S. aureus (87.8% MDR). Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles revealed the increased resistance (>85%) of these pathogens to penicillin, streptomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, and erythromycin. However, these pathogens showed increased susceptibility to ampicillin, amoxicillin-sulbactam, ceftazidime, neomycin, kanamycin, spectinomycin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and doxycycline. The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that old age, high parity, late lactation, lesions on teats, previous history of clinical mastitis, higher milk yield, and milking training were found to be potential risk factors (p < 0.001) associated with developing SCM in small-holder dairy cows in Gansu Province, China.

Antibiotics, the conventional treatment for eliminating H. pylori, often lead to severe bacterial resistance, gut dysbiosis, and hepatic insufficiency and fail to address the inflammatory response or gastric mucosal damage caused by H. pylori infection. In this study, based on 10-week animal experiments, two models of L. salivarius NCUH062003 for the prophylaxis and therapy of H. pylori infection in C57BL/6 mice were established; a comprehensive comparative analysis was performed to investigate the anti-H. pylori effect of probiotics, the reduction in inflammation, and repair of gastric mucosal damage. ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and pathology analyses showed that NCUH062003 decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukins (IL-1beta, IL-6) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and reduced neutrophil infiltration in the gastric mucosa lamina propria. Immunofluorescence and biochemical analysis showed that NCUH062003 resisted gastric epithelial cell apoptosis, increased the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in gastric mucosa, and promoted the expression of tight junction protein ZO1 and Occludin. In addition, through high-throughput sequencing, in the probiotic therapy and prophylactic mode, the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota of HP-infected mice were clarified, the potential functions of the gut microbiota were analyzed, the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured, and the effects of L. salivarius NCUH062003 on the gut microbiota and its metabolites in HP-infected mice treated with amoxicillin/metronidazole were revealed.

It is crucial to continuously monitor AMR, not only by investigating clinical, pathogenic strains but also by monitoring commensal bacterial strains, as they can serve as natural reservoirs of resistance. Infections caused by Enterococcus species are increasingly recognized as emerging threats to both animal and public health. Among economically important livestock, poultry as a major source of animal protein for humans is a frequent carrier of enterococci, and also of sporadically detected clinical disease. Methods: This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Enterococcus strains (n = 499) isolated from chicken farms in Hungary. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for 15 antibiotics, including 10 with established clinical breakpoints. Results: The strains exhibited good sensitivity to amoxicillin, one of the first-line treatments for Enterococcus infections in veterinary medicine, with only 20.8% showing resistance. However, we observed an alarming 27.9% resistance rate to vancomycin, which is reserved to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains in humans. A comparison of our findings with Hungarian hospital records revealed that the resistance patterns of poultry-derived Enterococcus faecalis strains were very similar to those of human isolates, particularly regarding penicillins and aminoglycosides.

39760897,2025,"BACKGROUND: Epidermal necrolysis (EN) is a rare and severe condition characterized by diffuse skin and mucosal detachment and mainly induced by drugs. The literature is scarce regarding the rate of recurrences and culprit drug re-exposure. OBJECTIVES: To assess the rate of EN recurrences and to examine re-exposure to high-notoriety drugs in patients with EN. METHODS: We used the French health system database and included all patients with EN. Suspected drugs were assessed at the onset of EN. The primary outcome was the rate of EN recurrence. Secondary outcomes were re-exposure or cross-exposure to high-notoriety drugs (exposure to a drug of the same family) after the acute stage of EN. RESULTS: In total, 1203 of 1440 patients (83.5%) survived the acute stage, with 27 patients (2.2%, 95% confidence interval 1.5-3.2) meeting the recurrence criteria. In patients with allopurinol as the suspected drug, 10 of 77 (13%) were cross-exposed to febuxostat, without recurrence. Similarly, in patients with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine as the suspected drug, 2 of 26 (8%) were cross-exposed to lamotrigine, without recurrence. Conversely, 12 of 38 (32%) and 16 of 37 (43%) patients were respectively re-exposed to pantoprazole and esomeprazole when initially suspected, and 12 of 42 (29%) were re-exposed to amoxicillin. Only one recurrence was noted in a patient re-exposed to pantoprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with EN, the rate of recurrence seems low, contrasting with several re-exposures to beta-lactam antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors when initially suspected. Although we cannot exclude that the suspected drugs were not the responsible ones for several patients, future studies should assess the possible existence of transient risk factors inducing EN.","[('necrolysis', 'DISEASE'), ('cross-exposure', 'CHEMICAL'), ('allopurinol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('febuxostat', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbamazepine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oxcarbazepine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('lamotrigine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pantoprazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('esomeprazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pantoprazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL')]"

RESULTS: Among 1250 recruited students, with an 89% response rate, PS and MS showed the highest knowledge level, whereas NS scored the lowest. The study revealed some misconceptions and malpractices among students. Two-thirds of PS and NS, half of DS, and a third of MS believed antibiotics treat sore throats. Sixty percent of NS and DS were unaware that vancomycin treats methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Over half of MS and NS and a third of DS and PS lacked knowledge of amoxicillin safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The prevalence of antibiotics self-medication (ABSM) was highest among PS (30%), followed by NS (27%) and DS (25%), while MS reported the lowest rate (16.6%). One-third of students preferred to use newer and more expensive antibiotics. Seven percent of the students used the local guidelines, 12% used the international guidelines as sources of information, and only 8% received relevant formal training. CONCLUSIONS: The study found misconceptions and injudicious antibiotic use among medical sector students. Effective educational interventions and relevant training are needed to enhance their KAP on rational antibiotic use to minimize antibiotic resistance.

39756020,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Identify common pathogens and antibiotic resistances in chronic rhinosinusitis patients post-endoscopic sinus surgery presenting with an active sinus infection. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Single-institution rhinology private practice in Southeast Florida. METHODS: Recorded postoperative endoscopically-guided sinus cultures from symptomatic patients with purulent drainage on endoscopy from August 2020 to December 2023. When available, pre- or intraoperatively cultured organisms were collected. RESULTS: Of 125 patients, 50.4% were female with a mean age of 51.0. In 34.4% of patients that underwent revision surgery, 76% had nasal polyps and 26.4% had asthma. Of 301 cultures, 264 (87.7%) were positive, 53 (17.6%) were polymicrobial, and 37 (12.3%) were negative. Of 351 total isolates, 165 (47%) were Gram-negative, 125 (35.6%) Gram-positive, 14 (4%) fungi, and 10 (2.8%) anaerobic. 46.9% of postoperative organisms were not cultured preoperatively. Gram-negative bacteria included Enterobacteriaceae (17.7%), Pseudomonas spp. (10.5%), Serratia spp. (5.1%). Gram-positive bacteria included Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 17.1%) and Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, 8%). Antibiotic resistances included MSSA to penicillins (52.8%) and clindamycin (32.8%), and MRSA resistance to quinolones (53.6%) and clindamycin (35.7%). Enterobacteriaceae were 42% resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and 37.1% to penicillins, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 17.7% resistant to quinolones. CONCLUSION: A cohort of chronic rhinosinusitis patients post-sinus surgery grew a large proportion of Gram-negative organisms and significant Staphylococcal penicillin and Gram-negative amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance. Our findings indicate the benefit of culturing patients with this patient presentation. If cultures cannot be obtained, we suggest broad-spectrum antibiotics that consider wide Gram-negative coverage and local antibiotic resistance patterns.","[('rhinosinusitis', 'DISEASE'), ('sinus infection', 'DISEASE'), ('purulent', 'DISEASE'), ('nasal polyps', 'DISEASE'), ('polymicrobial', 'DISEASE'), ('Enterobacteriaceae', 'DISEASE'), ('Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('MSSA', 'DISEASE'), ('MSSA', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('quinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('quinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rhinosinusitis', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39754681,2025,"The increasing supply shortages of antibacterial drugs presents significant challenges to public health in Germany. This study aims to predict the future consumption of the ten most prescribed antibacterial drugs in Germany up to 2040 using ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) models, based on historical prescription data. This analysis also evaluates the plausibility of the forecasts. Our findings represent one of the first long-term national forecasts for antibacterial drug consumption. ARIMA(0,1,0), a random walk model with drift, is the best-fitting model to capture trends across all antibacterial drugs. While more complex models offer greater detail, they seem less suitable for long-term forecasting. In a short-term forecast of 5 and 10 years, predictions between significant models vary very little. Predictions indicate increasing DDD-prescriptions for amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, amoxicillin clavulanic acid, clindamycin, azithromycin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin, while declines are forecasted for doxycycline, phenoxymethylpenicillin, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The reliability of the predictions varies. Forecasts for azithromycin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim are likely accurate, whereas uncertainties exist for doxycycline, amoxicillin clavulanic acid, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin, though general trends appear valid. Potential discrepancies may arise in the predictions for amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and clindamycin. These forecasts highlight the urgent need for proactive healthcare planning to prevent future shortages, a problem underscored by recent supply disruptions in Germany.

39754624,2025,"Due to the industry's rapid growth, the presence of organic pollutants, especially antibiotics, in water and wastewater resources is the main concern for wildlife and human health. Therefore, these days, a significant challenge is developing an efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly photocatalyst. Natural biological models have numerous advantages compared to artificial model materials. Biological models with unique multi-level structures and morphology can be used to create porous bio-templates to produce hierarchical materials. So, in this work, for the first time, this was achieved by using sorghum grain seeds as a bio-template (natural waste material) and urea as a precursor, through a simple and environmentally friendly method. We believed that natural waste materials with high carbon atom content could be used as both a carbon doping agent and a bio-template, thus improving the physical and optical properties of the resulting materials. In comparison to previous studies on the synthesis of C-doped g-C(3)N(4), our work offers a greener and more cost-effective approach to synthesis, while also reducing waste material.

39752455,2025,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a severe condition causing bilateral pitting edema or signs of wasting in children, with a high mortality risk. An outpatient therapeutic program is recommended for managing SAM children without complications, but there is limited information on recovery time and its determinants. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the time to recovery and its predictors among children aged 6-59 months with SAM admitted to the Outpatient therapeutic program in the Borena zone, Oromia region, Southern Ethiopia in 2023. METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was carried out from March 1-30, 2023, on 322 children aged 6-59 months in health facilities in the Borena zone. After being collected using a structured questionnaire, the data was imported into Epi Data Manager version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 26 for analysis. Model fitness was assessed using the log rank test, and time-to-recovery from SAM was found to be predicted by Cox regression analysis. Lastly, the study used the Adjusted Hazard Ratio with a p-value < 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval to describe the connection. RESULTS: The median duration for recovery was found to be 42 days with an interquartile range of 35 to 49. Children who received Amoxicillin had a four-times higher recovery rate (AHR = 4.09; 95% CI: 2.75, 6.07). The presence of diarrhea prolonged the recovery time by 53.0% (AHR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.62), while vomiting prolonged the recovery time by 58.0% (AHR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.55). Edema reduced the chances of recovery by 48% (AHR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.62). CONCLUSION: The study found that recovery time for children with severe acute malnutrition is consistent with prior research. Key factors influencing recovery duration include the prompt administration of Amoxicillin upon admission and the presence of symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, and edema. The findings emphasize the critical role of specific symptoms in predicting recovery times for children with SAM. By understanding these relationships, healthcare providers can enhance treatment strategies, improve resource management, and ultimately contribute to better health outcomes for affected children.","[('pitting edema', 'DISEASE'), ('wasting', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('vomiting', 'DISEASE'), ('Edema', 'DISEASE'), ('malnutrition', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('vomiting', 'DISEASE'), ('edema', 'DISEASE')]"

Each patient underwent an amoxicillin provocation test, after obtaining informed consent. RESULTS: 60 patients were registered, who were able to remove the penicillin allergy label and whose medical history was corrected, with financial benefits for the patient and the health service of Paraguay. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin allergy labels can lead to irrational prescription of antibiotics, prolonged hospital stays, and increased need for consultation.

The increasing ineffectiveness of traditional antibiotics has intensified the need to explore medicinal plants as viable therapeutic options. This study sought to compare the efficacy of certain medicinal plants used in Owerri, Nigeria, for treating pathogenic bacteria against traditional commercial antibiotics. We tested graded concentrations (25 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 75 mg/ml, and 100 mg/ml) of ethanolic extracts of Awolowo leaf (Chromolaena odorata), Bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina), and Lemon grass leaf (Cymbopogon citratus) against Salmonella spp, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus employing the agar well diffusion method to measure zones of inhibition. Commercial antibiotics studied included: Pefloxacin, Gentamycin, Ampiclox, Zinnacef, Amoxicillin, Rocephin, Ciprofloxacin, Streptomycin, Septrin and Erythromycin, Sparfloxacin Amoxicillin, Augmentin, and Tarivid. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. Results were analyzed descriptively and presented as mean zones of inhibition and standard deviations. One to three plant species exhibited antibacterial activities (zones of inhibition) across 25-100 mg/ml concentrations. In contrast, some or all antibiotics only exhibited antibacterial activities at 100 mg/ml concentration (none at 25-75 mg/ml concentrations). Zones of inhibition (10.3-14.1 mm) of all three plant species against E.coli and Klebsiella at 100 mg/ml concentration were higher than those of 8-10 antibiotics. C. odorata had shown high zones of inhibition of 11.8 and 11.0 mm against Salmonella spp. and S. aureus at 100 mg/ml concentration, which were higher than those of eight antibiotics. The other two plant species (C. citratus and V. amygdalina) had exhibited low zones of inhibition against Salmonella spp. and S. aureus, which were higher than those of 3 or 4 antibiotics at 100 mg/ml concentration. In general, the antibacterial activities of the three plant species across 25-100 mg/ml concentrations were higher than those of many antibiotics. To a large extent, the efficacy of medicinal plant extracts across different concentrations against bacterial strains was higher than that of many antibiotics. Those plant species have therefore shown some potential to be used as alternative or complementary therapeutics to antibiotics in addressing antibiotic resistance. Since the promising findings were based on an in vitro study, we recommend clinical trials to establish safe and effective doses of those plant extracts in humans.","[('Pefloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Gentamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ampiclox', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Rocephin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Streptomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Septrin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Sparfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Augmentin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('E.coli', 'DISEASE')]"

Understanding the changes in the prevalence of common uropathogens is essential for early diagnosis and effective treatment of UTIs. This study aimed to identify etiological agents and determine the local antibiotic susceptibility patterns of uropathogens causing UTIs. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study from January 2017 to December 2022 was conducted on hospitalized neonates at Maternity Hospital, Kuwait. Urine samples from neonates were analyzed to identify isolates, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined using the VITEK(R) 2 system. RESULTS: Out of 3,996 urine samples processed, 282 (7%) samples yielded significant bacteriuria, mostly from male 185 (65.6%). Gram-negative isolates were the most common 141 (50%), followed by yeasts 84 (29.8%) and Gram-positive isolates 57 (20.2%). The common uropathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae 50 (17.7%), followed by Escherichia coli 47 (16.8%), Candida albicans 39 (13.8%), Enterococcus faecalis 34 (12%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis 17 (6%). High resistance rates were observed among Enterobacterales against ampicillin, cephalothin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. A total of 28 (56%) K. pneumoniae and 18 (38.3%) E. coli were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative isolates are considered the predominant causative agents of UTIs in neonates at Maternity Hospital. Reduced antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics poses a notable challenge in the clinical management of neonates with UTIs.

39745445,2025,"Determination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pneumococcal isolates is important for surveillance purposes and in a clinical context. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of pneumococci is complicated by the need for exact minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of beta-lactam antibiotics. Two next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis tools have implemented the prediction of AMR in their analysis workflow, including the prediction of MICs: Pathogenwatch (https://pathogen.watch/) and AREScloud (OpGen). The performance of these tools in comparison to phenotypic AST following EUCAST guidelines is unknown. A total of 538 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were used to compare both tools with phenotypic AST for penicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. Disk diffusion was performed for all isolates, and broth microdilution was performed for isolates with reduced beta-lactam susceptibility. Demultiplexed FASTQ files from Illumina sequencing, covering the whole genome of pneumococci, were used as input for the NGS tools. Categorical agreement (CA), major error (ME), and very major error (VME) rates were calculated. For beta-lactam antibiotics, CA was high (>94%) associated with none or only one ME and VME (<1%). For erythromycin and tetracycline, CA was >93% for predictions by AREScloud, while for Pathogenwatch, this ranged around 88%. For trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, CA was for both tools <86%. High VME rates were observed for erythromycin and tetracycline, higher for Pathogenwatch (53.6% and 47.0%, respectively) compared to AREScloud (14.3% and 19.1%, respectively). Both tools performed excellently despite the complexity of predicting beta-lactam resistance in pneumococci.

Leveraging in vitro and in vivo information on the pharmacokinetics of the three components of RHB-105, we developed mechanistic absorption PBPK models to predict plasma and intragastric concentration-time profiles for each component. There were only negligible differences in the area under the concentration-time curves (AUC) for plasma and the intragastric compartment, and maximal concentration (C(max)) with only up to a 1.1-fold difference for rifabutin, amoxicillin, and omeprazole between dosing schedules. Overlapping 90% confidence intervals for both AUC and C(max) support that overall exposures are comparable regardless of dosing every 8 h or three-times daily for all three drugs. Drug exposure was highly similar for rifabutin, amoxicillin, and omeprazole with each dosing schedule.

This study investigated the distribution of antibiotic-resistant phenotypes and genotypes of H. pylori in Hainan Province. It determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of six antibiotics using the E-test method and detected resistance genes via Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, we compared resistance detection based on phenotypic analysis and whole genome sequencing (WGS) across 19 clinical isolates of H. pylori. A total of 140 H. pylori strains were isolated. The resistance rates to levofloxacin (LEV), clarithromycin (CLA), and metronidazole (MTZ) were 37.9%, 40.0%, and 93.6%, respectively. Notably, only 3.3% of the strains were susceptible to all six antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant strains accounted for 25.0% of the total, with no resistance detected to amoxicillin (AMX), tetracycline (TET), or furazolidone (FR) during the study period. Genotypic resistance to CLA and LEV showed near-perfect concordance with phenotypic resistance, with Kappa values of 0.910 and 0.938, respectively. Although all isolates were phenotypically sensitive to TET, 16 exhibited a mutation in the 16S rRNA gene (A926G). All strains harboring the R16H/C mutation and truncated rdxA were resistant to metronidazole, demonstrating a specificity of 100%. Therefore, FR, AMX, and TET are recommended as suitable empirical treatment options for H. pylori infections in this region.

Vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, presents rapid, potent, and long-lasting acid inhibitory effects compared to esomeprazole. However, there is currently a scarcity of direct comparisons between the 10-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin (VA) and the 14-day EA dual therapy for H. pylori eradication. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of the 10-day VA and the 14-day EA dual therapy for H. pylori first-line eradication. DESIGN: This study was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The study was conducted at 10 hospitals in China. In total, 570 newly diagnosed H. pylori-infected patients were recruited from April 2023 to February 2024. These patients were randomly assigned to either the 10-day VA group (vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily + amoxicillin 1000 mg three times daily) or the 14-day EA group (esomeprazole 20 mg four times daily + amoxicillin 750 mg four times daily). The primary outcome was the eradication rate, with secondary outcomes including adverse events and compliance. RESULTS: The 10-day VA regimen outperformed the 14-day EA regimen in terms of eradication rates in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (85.4% vs 76.7%, p = 0.008), modified ITT analysis (90.7% vs 84.8%, p = 0.036), and per-protocol (PP) analysis (91.1% versus 85.5%, p = 0.047).

Health disparities (HD) can create barriers in optimizing penicillin allergy care. Objective: The objective was to characterize HDs in our primary care-led amoxicillin challenge (PLAC) delabeling pathway within a universal coverage health care system. Methods: In three outpatient clinic sites, 41,104 patients were screened, and 1,749 patients were discovered to have penicillin allergies. Of the 1,749 patients with penicillin allergy, 336 (ages 4 months to 76 years) were determined to be candidates for PLAC. A retrospective chart review was completed after 1 year of PLAC implementation to compare demographic characteristics and HD core categories (neighborhood living type, economic stability, background education status, and access to care) between those who completed and those who did not complete their PLAC appointment. All candidates underwent the same PLAC protocol and had universal health coverage that reduced health cost. Results: Of 336 PLAC candidates (45.8%), 154 presented for their PLAC appointment and had their penicillin allergy removed without adverse outcomes. One hundred and eighty-two candidates (54.2%) did not complete a PLAC appointment and retained their penicillin allergy label. Candidates who did not complete their PLAC appointment were older (p = 0.001) and white (p = 0.006), and did not identify as officers (p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in neighborhood type or gender between the groups. In candidates ages >/= 19 years, those without proactively scheduled appointments more commonly (p < 0.001) did not complete their PLAC appointment; whereas proactive scheduling increased delabeling from 5.8% to 91.3% in candidates ages >/= 19 years. Of the 199 candidates with proactively scheduled PLAC appointments, those with less perceived economic stability and background education status (enlisted members) were more likely not to attend their PLAC appointment (p < 0.001).

A 32-year-old male patient with transfusion-independent beta-thalassemia intermedia presented with symptomatic anemia. His blood sample typed as group B, D+ and demonstrated multiple alloantibodies and cold autoantibodies. He was transfused uneventfully, but re-presented 10 days later with recurrent, worsening anemia. At this time, transfusion of group O, phenotype-matched red blood cells (RBCs) resulted in an acute hemolytic reaction. While anemia was initially attributed to drug-mediated bone marrow toxicit y and subsequently to a delayed hemolytic reaction, further evaluation revealed Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and a cold agglutinin (anti-IH specificity), indicating a likely autoimmune-mediated anemia due to an infectious etiology. Subsequent transfusion of 2 group B, phenotype-matched RBC units using a blood warmer was uneventful. Anti-IH is only rarely associated with hemolytic transfusion reactions, which may be exacerbated when transfusing group O RBC units to group B patients. M. pneumoniae infection likely led to cold agglutinin-mediated hemolysis of endogenous and transfused RBCs. The patient was successfully managed with intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, rituximab, erythropoietin, hydroxyurea, and amoxicillin clavulanate/azithromycin.

39736304,2025,"Herein, we propose magnetic nanocomposites as a powerful new catalyst for organic pollutant reduction. Polypyrrole (PPy) was synthesized in situ within the semi-interpenetrating alginate (Alg)/gelatin (Ge) network in presence of alpha-Fe(2)O(3) as encapsulating matrix and inorganic filler, respectively. The polymeric matrix can act as bifunctional agent such as a binder and stabilizer to improve nanocatalyst stability while preserving their catalytic/magnetic performances. The results showed that Alg/Ge/PPy/Fe(2)O(3) catalyst was more effective than its Alg/Ge/PPy and Alg/Ge/PPy/Fe(2)O(3) homologues, suggesting a synergistic effect between PPy and alpha-Fe(2)O(3) for efficient pollutant removal. Nevertheless, despite the fact that the nanocatalysts showed good catalytic activity for all selected organic pollutants, a selectivity was observed in the following order: methyl orange (MO) > direct red 16 > congo red>amoxicillin>ciprofloxacin>acetamiprid with a rate constant k of 0.54 min-1 achieved for MO reduction over Alg/Ge/PPy/Fe(2)O(3). The proposed mechanism for MO reduction based on HPLC-Q-TOF analysis supports the rupture of azo bond through hydrogenation. Moreover, magnetic nanocatalysts were easily recovered and reused without apparent loss of catalytic activity up to six successive cycles (89 %), and under different mineral salt samples. Lastly, the advantage of the optimized catalyst lies in its reduced manufacturing cost compared with those based on gold, platinum or silver.","[('Polypyrrole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('alginate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nanocatalysts', 'CHEMICAL'), ('methyl', 'CHEMICAL'), ('congo', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('acetamiprid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('platinum', 'CHEMICAL'), ('silver', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Pigs are a significant reservoir and are frequently subclinical carriers. The aim of this study was to detect the occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates being the five most important for public health Salmonella serovars in fattening pigs in Bulgaria. The isolation of Salmonella spp. was carried out according to EN ISO 6579-1 for the detection of Salmonella bacteria in feces and Salmonella serotyping following the Kauffmann-White scheme. All confirmed S. enterica isolates were analysed by the disk-diffusion method for susceptibility to 14 antimicrobials. Salmonella enterica was detected in 13 out of 32 tested farms in Bulgaria. The overall percentage of Salmonella positive pooled fecal samples was 6.8% (43 of 630 samples). The highest occurrence was present in fattening pigs aged between 121-180 days (16.3%; 20/123), followed by dry sows (6.5%; 4/62) and gilts (4.8%; 12/248).

In those colistin-resistant E. coli (mcr-1 to -9), the major carbapenemase (blaOXA-48, blaNDM-1, blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaKPC), beta-lactamase (blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M and blaSHV-1) and OXA-48 like beta- lactamase (blaOXA-162, blaOXA-163, blaOXA-181, blaOXA-204 and blaOXA-232) resistance genes were searched for determined a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and Next-generation sequencing (NGS) - PCR Amplicons with Nanopore Technology. Only the mcr-4 gene was found in one isolate and the remaining genes (mcr-1-9) were not shown in all E. coli isolates from cattle. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to colistin was detected in mcr-4 positive E. coli isolates using broth microdilution. We assessed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of mcr-4 positive E. coli isolates using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. E coli isolate was detected as negative for carbapenemase and OXA-48 like beta-lactamase resistance genes and positive for beta-lactamase. In addition, E. coli isolates carrying mcr-4 were more resistant to colistin. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion assay indicated that all 106 E. coli isolates (100%) were sensitive to AMK, 105 E. coli isolates (99.1%) exhibited sensitivity to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem, and 1 E. coli isolate (0.9%) had intermediate resistance to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem; It was observed that all strains (100%) were resistant to cefotaxime.

METHODS: This study assessed the hostel gutters of two Nigerian universities, the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN) and Kogi State University, Anyigba (KSU), for E. coli and its antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). Oxoid Chromogenic UTI agar was used to isolate uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), identified using standard biochemical tests. The virulence and resistance genes of the isolates were further characterized using molecular techniques. RESULTS: A total of 906 UPEC were isolated in this study, of which 63 isolates were selected for antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The UPEC isolates showed 100% resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, vancomycin, and penicillin G, while a complete sensitivity of the isolates to meropenem and ciprofloxacin was observed. The index of isolates showing multidrug resistance ranged from 0.33 to 0.73. The level of multiple drug resistance (MDR) exhibited by the UPEC isolates from effluent was significantly higher compared to those from influent (p < 0.05). The ARGs detected were blaOXA-1 8 (38.1%), blaCTX-M3 8 (38.1%), and ant(2)-la 20 (95.2%). Virulence genes encodings beta-glucuronidase (uidA) and hemolysin A (hlyA) were detected in 95.2% of UPEC isolates.

39734108,2025,"PURPOSE: High doses of amoxicillin are recommended to treat severe infections such as endocarditis. Amoxicillin causes dose-dependent toxicities, in particular crystal nephropathy. Toxicity could be avoided by monitoring of amoxicillin trough plasma concentrations (ATPC). However, the relevance of ATPC testing in routine medical practice remains poorly studied. METHODS: We conducted a prospective clinical trial in adults treated with high doses of discontinuous intravenous amoxicillin in a French university hospital. The primary outcome was the distribution of ATPCs over three days during the first week of treatment. Urine tests for amoxicillin crystalluria (AC), pH, and density were also performed. FINDINGS: Seventy patients were included. Overall intra-class correlation (ICC) was 0.35 IC95% [0.21; 0.53] with the following pairwise concordances: D1-D4 (n= 55) 0.23 IC95% [-0.02; 0.47], D1-D7 (n= 47) 0.41 IC95% [0.19; 0.63], and D4-D7 (n= 50) 0.17 IC95% [-0.10; 0.43]. Inter-individual variability was also significant, with coefficients of variation being 0.87 at D1, 1.20 at D4, and 1.35 at D7. AC occurred in 32 patients (47.8%). Risk of AC increased when pH was below or equal to 6 (P = 0.002). ATPCs were higher in patients with AC and/or acute kidney injury. IMPLICATIONS: Variability in ATPC was high and ATPC cannot be considered as the only monitoring tool to adjust amoxicillin dosage. High ATPC, low urinary pH, and presence of AC can alert physicians to a potential iatrogenic effect and lead to the decision to hydrate the patient, alkalinize urine and decrease the dosage of amoxicillin.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('endocarditis', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('toxicities', 'DISEASE'), ('nephropathy', 'DISEASE'), ('Toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin crystalluria', 'CHEMICAL'), ('acute kidney injury', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hydrate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

However, the poor solubility and high volatility of TTO limited the clinical application. Therefore, tea tree oil and Tween 80 were formulated into a stable nanoemulsion (Nano TTO). We attested that Nano TTO, as an antibiotic adjuvant, enhanced the antibacterial activity of amoxicillin (AMX) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and inhibited the formation of biofilms. Mechanistic studies proved that the Nano TTO potentiation effect on AMX was primarily the result of inhibition of the Agr expression by targeting the accessory regulator AgrA.

This study provides an assessment of potential ecological risks (RQ) associated with the concentrations of eight antibiotics and antiparasitics (amoxicillin-AMO, azithromycin-AZI, ciprofloxacine-CIP, ofloxacine-OFL, oxfendazole-OXF, lincomycin-LIN, sulfacetamide-SCE and sulfamethoxazole-SME) in the surface water of 13 urban lakes in Hanoi city, Vietnam during the period 2021-2023. The findings revealed considerable variations in the total concentrations of these 8 substances (T(AB)), ranging from below the method detection limit (< MDL) to 2240 ng L(-1) with an average of 330.4 ng L(-1). Among the 8 antibiotics and antiparasitics examined, OXF, AMO, and SCE were undetectable, while the others were present at a range of concentrations (in ng L(-1)): OFL: 129 (< MDL-1530); CIP: 87.1 (< MDL-608); LIN: 72.7 (< MDL-676); SME: 41.5 (< MDL-504); AZI: 0.03 (< MDL-1). The calculated RQ values for these antibiotics in the Hanoi lakes indicated a high ecological risk for OFL and CIP to bacteria, a medium to high risk for SME for phytoplankton, a high risk for LIN to phytoplankton, while the risk for invertebrates was deemed negligible for all antibiotics across all lakes. The strong, positive correlation between T(AB) concentrations and different microbial and environmental variables (Escherichia coli, ammonium, phosphate, and chemical oxygen demand) suggests that untreated domestic wastewater is the primary pollution source in these Hanoi lakes. These results should be used to raise public awareness and to encourage the implementation of strategies targeted at managing antibiotic use.

39732678,2024,"BACKGROUND: Endodontic emergencies, often presented as acute pain or swelling, constitute a substantial challenge in dental practice. While effective management emphasizes prompt intervention, antibiotics are typically indicated only when systemic signs and symptoms are present. There is limited research exists on evaluating the knowledge and clinical approach of dental practitioners in managing endodontic emergencies from our region of the world. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate dentists' knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding clinical management and the prescription of antibiotics in endodontic emergency cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was distributed to working dentists in secondary and tertiary care hospitals and clinics. Eligible participants included dental practitioners, postgraduate trainees, and consultants. The questionnaire included demographic information and inquiries about endodontic emergency treatment approaches, antibiotic prescribing habits, and awareness of guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed Stata software version 17 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA), employing a chi2 test. RESULTS: Of the 527 dentists approached, 409 completed the survey (response rate: 77.6%). The majority of respondents were female (68%) and general dental practitioners (60.32%) with up to 5 years of experience (80.93%). Survey findings highlighted varied treatment approaches, favoring root canal treatment in multiple visits for cases of both irreversible pulpitis (73.59%) as well as with necrotic pulps/periapical lesions (79.95%). Similarly, 45.48% and 37.9% of the respondents favored pulpectomy combined with analgesics and antibiotics in managing irreversible pulpitis and acute apical periodontitis respectively. Moreover, antibiotics were frequently prescribed for acute apical abscess, with amoxicillin-clavulanate being the most common choice (83.6%). Most practitioners (69%) recommended a minimum of 5-day antibiotic course.

The S. aureus isolates exhibiting resistance to Penicillin and Cefoxitin disc on Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method were considered as beta-lactam resistant S. aureus (BRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) which were further confirmed by PCR targeting blaZ and mecA genes, respectively. The results showed that S. aureus was found in 57.06% of subclinical (SCM) positive camel milk samples. A high molecular prevalence of BRSA and MRSA were found to be 48.51% and 46.53% respectively depicting that treating these infections is challenging due to their high resistance levels. The phylogenetic analysis revealed a significant resemblance of the study isolates with each other and with already reported sequences from different countries which shows the potential for the spread of pathogen. Virulence profiling of antibiotic resistance strains showed the presence of virulence markers (nuc and coag genes), intercellular adhesion genes (icaA, icaD), Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl) gene, and enterotoxin-producing genes including sea, seb, sec, and sed. In-vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that the most resistant antibiotic group was penicillin followed by aminoglycosides and cephalosporins. Drug repurposing analysis of different non-antibiotics for combination therapies with resistant antibiotics was done to combat the S. aureus isolates harboring the mecA and blaZ genes.

A total of 450 raw cow milk samples were collected from 18 farms within the CMA. The isolation and identification of E. coli were performed following standard bacteriological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was conducted using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Molecular detection of E. coli and antimicrobial resistance genes was performed using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This study found 134 (29.77%) milk samples that tested positive for E. coli. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) revealed the highest resistance rates (69.40%) to be for ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin, and cephalexin, with the lowest resistance (21.64%) being for norfloxacin. A significant correlation (r = 1) was observed between ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime resistance among the antimicrobials tested. All E. coli isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR), being resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes, with a multiple resistance index >0.2.

Methods: An online cross-sectional study on 303 dentists in Saudi Arabia was conducted. A closed-ended survey consisting of 28 questions was designed. Three sections were created, i.e., (1) participants' characteristics; (2) knowledge of peri-implantitis etiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and complications; and (3) the use of antibiotics to manage peri-implantitis and methods used for diagnosis and treatment. The data were analyzed using mean and percentages. Results: A total of 303 dentists participated in this study with a 78.8% response rate, comprising 80% general dentists and 20% specialists. The majority of dentists demonstrated knowledge about peri-implantitis, with 85.5% identifying bacterial plaque as an etiologic factor and 83.8% recognizing it as an inflammatory reaction. Regarding risk factors, 88.1% identified smoking and 86.1% recognized periodontitis as contributors to peri-implant disease development. In terms of clinical decision making, 63% of participants considered implant mobility as a definitive indication for implant removal, and more than half reported using crater-like bone defects surrounding implants as a diagnostic criterion for peri-implantitis. For antimicrobial therapy, amoxicillin alone (30%) was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic, followed by the combination of amoxicillin with metronidazole (29%). Despite these treatment approaches, it is important to note that currently there are no established, predictable protocols for treating any phase of peri-implant disease.

39727338,2025,"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a powerful analytical technique, yet it faces challenges with certain probe molecules exhibiting weak or inactive signals, limiting their applicability. In a recent study, we investigated this phenomenon using a set of four probe molecules horizontal line chloramphenicol (CAP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), amoxicillin (AMX), and furazolidone (FZD) horizontal line deposited on Ag-based nanostructured SERS substrates. Despite being measured under identical conditions, CAP and 4-NP exhibited SERS activity, while AMX and FZD did not. We also demonstrated that the alignment of the target molecule's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level with the substrate's Fermi level plays a critical role in influencing the SERS signal. When the LUMO level diverges from the Fermi level, hindrance of the charge transfer process occurs due to a high potential barrier, leading to weak or absent SERS signals. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we introduce an approach inspired by metal-semiconductor interfacial charge transfer dynamics. By employing TiO(2)/Ag nanostructures, we not only enhance SERS signals for CAP and 4-NP but also activate signals for inactive molecules AMX and FZD. Importantly, we demonstrate that controlling the crystalline phase composition of the TiO(2) semiconductor allows for tailored conduction band minimum energy level (E(CBM)) positions, significantly impacting the overall SERS efficiency of the TiO(2)/Ag substrate. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the semiconductor's E(CBM) position in the energy alignment of the metal-semiconductor-analyte three-body interaction for an optimal SERS sensing platform.

We aimed to investigate the extent of overall agreement among clinicians in the Asia-Pacific region regarding the management of H. pylori infection. METHODS: The Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Focus Group of the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology-Emerging Leaders Committee developed an international survey, which was distributed to 98 clinicians in the Asia-Pacific region, compromising an online questionnaire focusing on the management of H. pylori infection. RESULTS: Participants responded from Japan (15, 15.3%), Hong Kong (15, 15.3%), Thailand (33, 33.7%), Vietnam (23, 23.5%), Malaysia (4, 4.1%), Singapore (3, 3.1%), and others (5, 5.1%). The most common first-line eradication regimen was clarithromycin (CAM) triple therapy, including proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin (AMPC), and CAM (64.3%) for 14 days (70.4%). The most common second-line eradication regimen was levofloxacin (LVX) triple therapy, including PPI, AMPC, and LVX (22.4%) for 14 days (67.3%). Eradication therapy was deemed necessary for all asymptomatic adults and minors (aged </= 17 years) currently infected with H. pylori by 81.6% and 64.3% of respondents, respectively, with 82.7% considering upper GI endoscopy for GC screening useful in the secondary prevention of GC. CONCLUSION: There appears to be a growing consensus among clinicians, acknowledging the necessity of eradication therapy.

39725335,2025,"Peri-urban environments, characterized by dense human populations, cohabiting livestock, and complex food systems, serve as hotspots for food contamination and infectious diseases. Children aged 6-24 months are particularly vulnerable, as they often encounter contaminated food and water, increasing their risk of food-borne disease, with diarrhea being a common symptom. We investigated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pathogenic Escherichia coli from children 6-24 months of age, their food, and cohabiting livestock, in Dagoretti South subcounty in Nairobi, Kenya. Of 540 stools, 296 livestock feces, and 859 food samples collected from 585 randomly enrolled households, 16% harbored diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) pathotypes. The predominant AMR phenotypes observed were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and tetracycline at 53%, 48% and 41%, respectively. Diarrheagenic E. coli from children showed significantly higher resistance to all antibiotics compared to those from livestock and food. Overall, 30% of the 274 DEC isolates from all three sources exhibited multidrug resistance. Network analysis of AMR co-occurrence revealed two clusters: (1) ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and chloramphenicol; and (2) nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and ceftriaxone. The co-resistance backbone of ampicillin-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline was significantly higher among isolates from children than from other hosts (chi(2) = 29.858, df = 2, adjusted P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that on-site disposal of animal manure and garbage, along with a recent history of diarrhea, were significantly associated with AMR carriage in children (P < 0.05).

However, the available oral antibiotic treatment options for ESBL-EC are limited. Herein, we report the cases of two children diagnosed with UTI caused by ESBL-EC (ESBL-UTI) who were switched from empirical intravenous antibiotics in UTI to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMPC/CVA) (14:1) after the causative organism was found to be ESBL-EC. A 3-month-old infant and an 8-month-old infant were admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of fever. In both cases, UTI was suspected based on urinalysis results, and intravenous cefotaxime was started as an empiric antibiotic. In both cases, ESBL-EC was detected in urine culture, and the diagnosis of ESBL-UTI was confirmed. Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed resistance to cefotaxime, but fever resolution was obtained in both cases following administration of intravenous cefotaxime. Since fever resolution was achieved, the antimicrobial was switched to oral AMPC/CVA (14:1) monotherapy with reference to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and the two patients were discharged on days 5-6 of hospitalization. Antimicrobials were administered intravenously and orally for a total of 2 weeks. Chronic-phase technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy showed no renal scarring. ESBL-UTI may require 2 weeks of intravenous antibacterial therapy, but in this case, both patients could be treated without renal scarring after conversion to oral AMPC/CVA alone.

39723254,2024,"BACKGROUND: Although biological plausibility suggests that fluoroquinolones could lead to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) through collagen degradation, real-world evidence on their relative risk of RRD is inconsistent, with limited information on absolute risk estimates. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to estimate the RRD risk associated with fluoroquinolones versus other antibiotics with similar indications (i.e., comparison antibiotics). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing claims data from adult patients who initiated fluoroquinolones or amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam or extended-spectrum cephalosporins using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (2009-2018) and the United States IBM MarketScan Database (2011-2020). Patients were followed for up to 90 days after cohort entry. For each country's data, after 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching, we used Cox regression models to estimate RRD risks, presented with hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We used random-effects meta-analyses to derive pooled HRs across both counties. RESULTS: Of 24,172,032 eligible patients comprising 7,944,620 insured Taiwanese (mean age [SD], 46 [18] years; 45% male) and 16,227,412 United States commercially insured individuals (mean age [SD], 47 [16] years; 40% male), 10,137,468 patients initiated fluoroquinolones, 10,203,794 initiated amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam, and 3,830,770 initiated extended-spectrum cephalosporins. After PS matching, similar RRD incidence rates were observed between fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam users (0.33 [95% CI, 0.19-0.56] versus 0.35 [95% CI, 0.26-0.46] per 1,000 person-years), yielding an HR of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.76-1.23). The RRD incidence rates were also similar comparing fluoroquinolones to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (0.36 [95% CI, 0.22-0.57] versus 0.34 [95% CI, 0.22-0.50] per 1,000 person-years; HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.92-1.27]). The comparative safety profiles remained consistent by country, various patient characteristic (e.g., diabetes or ophthalmic conditions), type of fluoroquinolones, follow-up duration, or treatment setting. CONCLUSION: This large-scale study, leveraging real-world data from Taiwan and the United States, showed a low and comparable RRD risk among adults who initiated fluoroquinolones or other antibiotics with similar indications. This suggests that the RRD risk should not deter the use of fluoroquinolone when clinically indicated.","[('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rhegmatogenous retinal detachment', 'DISEASE'), ('RRD', 'DISEASE'), ('RRD', 'DISEASE'), ('RRD', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin/sulbactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('RRD', 'DISEASE'), ('24,172,032', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('10,203,794', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin/sulbactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin/sulbactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diabetes', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('RRD', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolone', 'CHEMICAL')]"

This study aims to analyze the high-risk factors and pathogenic bacteria of PI, design a nomogram to predict the risk of PI occurrence, and provide clinical guidance for prevention and treatment to improve maternal outcomes. METHODS: A total of 525 pregnant women were included in the study. The mothers were randomly divided into a training cohort (n=367) and a test cohort (n=158). The performance of our model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analyses. All the women in the group of PI underwent blood culture tests, if the bacteria were detected, drug sensitivity tests were performed. The drug sensitivity spectrum was recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that 12 indicators were significantly different (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed 6 factors, such as parity, number of vaginal examinations, amount of postpartum bleeding, antibiotics administered in one week before admission, induced labor, and indwelling catheter were significantly different between the PI group and control group (P < 0.05). The area under the ROC curve was 0.904 (95% CI: 0.871-0.936) in the training set and 0.890 (95% CI: 0.837-0.942) in the test set. The calibration curve of the nomogram showed good agreement between prediction and observation. The analysis of the clinical decision curve showed that the nomogram is of practical significance. There were 100 patients with positive blood cultures in the PI group, and Escherichia.coli was the main pathogenic bacteria, accounting for 89%. The sensitivity to Meropenem and Imipenem was 100%, to Piperacillin tazobactam 97.75%, to Ceftazidime 95.51%, and to Amoxicillin/Clavulanat (AMC) was 93.26%. CONCLUSION: The risk of PI will be significantly reduced by controlling the number of vaginal examinations less than 4 times, postpartum hemorrhage less than 414ml, and reducing the time of urethral catheter indwelling.

Despite global control of pertussis cases through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), there has been a significant increase in the incidence of pertussis in recent years, characterized by a ""resurgence"" in developed countries with high immunization rates as well as a comparable reemergence in certain areas of China. We aim to explore the genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of circulating BP from children in Hebei. STUDY DESIGN: Children diagnosed with BP infection from 2019 to 2020 in Hebei, China were enrolled. We performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, mltilocus sequence typing (MLST), multilocus antigen sequence typing (MAST), multilevel genome typing (MGT). A total of 313 international BP genomes were selected for comparison to examine the genomic diversity and evolutionary traits of Chinese strains within a global framework. RESULTS: Sixty-two individuals were identified with BP infection via culture, yielding a positive rate of 15.62% (62/397) for BP. Two phylogenetic groups were identified, each carrying a dominating genotype. The two vaccine strains, CS and Tohama I, exhibited a distant relationship to these two groups. This study identified 56 erythromycin-resistant isolates, 55 azithromycin-resistant isolates, 58 sulfamethoxazole-sensitive isolates, and 53 cefotaxime-sensitive isolates. All BP isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and meropenem. Meanwhile, all erythromycin-resistant strains, which belonged to lineage I and MGT2 sequence type 7 (ST7), shared the ptxP1 gene and contained the 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. The major MAST was prn1/ptxP1/ptxA1/fim3-1/fim2-1 (75.81%). All 62 BP strains were divided into 1, 2, 3, 14, and 52 types at the MGT1, MGT2, MGT3, MGT4, and MGT5 levels, respectively. CONCLUSION: This work showed that there may be a link between antimicrobial resistance and alterations in specific molecular types, and the isolates showed a clear change when compared with the vaccine strain and that selection pressure from both antibiotics and immunization may be responsible for driving Chinese BP evolution, and necessitate a reevaluation of the immunization strategy and the development of novel vaccines in China to halt the resurgence and medication resistance of pertussis.","[('Pertussis', 'DISEASE'), ('respiratory disease', 'DISEASE'), ('Bordetella pertussis', 'DISEASE'), ('BP infection', 'DISEASE'), ('nucleotide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('SNP', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MGT', 'DISEASE'), ('BP infection', 'DISEASE'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39722595,2025,"AIMS: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), the dominating cause of gastric cancer, most often infects children initiating inflammation in the antral part and spreads orally to the oxyntic mucosa. Traditionally, eradication of H. pylori has been based upon a combination of antibiotics together with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce gastric destruction of the antibiotics. Recently it has been shown that the more efficient inhibitors of acid secretion, the potassium-competitive acid blockers (PCABs) in combination with amoxicillin alone gave highly sufficient H. pylori eradication. METHODS: To further elucidate the importance of gastric acidity we studied the literature for the connection between gastric acidity and the presence of H. pylori. RESULTS: It is well-known that H. pylori is dependent of some acidity in the surroundings to neutralize NH(3) produced by its urease, explaining the loss of H. pylori in total oxyntic atrophy. With adequate dosing PCABs can induce almost complete anacidity for 24-h which probably is necessary for H. pylori eradication. Even a short period with hypergastrinemia may induce mutations in the target cell of gastrin, the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell which may contribute to the relatively short interval between H. pylori eradication and gastric cancer in the users of profound acid inhibitors. CONCLUSION: The use of PCABs alone dosed sufficiently seems promising for H. pylori eradication, but a combination with a gastrin antagonist would be preferable.","[('gastric cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('PCABs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('oxyntic atrophy', 'DISEASE'), ('PCABs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('hypergastrinemia', 'DISEASE'), ('gastrin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('gastric cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('PCABs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('gastrin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Middle ear discharge samples were collected and aerobic bacteria were isolated and identified using standard microbiological methods. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method, and biofilm formation was assessed using the microtiter plate assay. RESULTS: Of the 457 cases, 89.72 % were monomicrobial infections. The most prevalent Gram-negative bacterium was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.71 %), while Staphylococcus aureus (26.27 %) was the leading Gram-positive pathogen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated high resistance, with 96.77 % resistant to cefuroxime and 92.26 % to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Similarly, Staphylococcus aureus showed significant resistance to ampicillin (83.33 %) and amoxicillin (78.07 %).

However, with the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (2022), the incidence of pneumococcal disease (PD) and even invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) began to rise again. METHODS: This study was conducted from August 2022 to September 2023 at a national regional medical center based mainly in West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University. The demographic and clinical characteristics of S. pneumoniae-infected pediatric patients were analyzed. All S. pneumoniae isolates were subjected to standardized clinical sample inoculation, culture, subculture, and identification procedures. Next-generation sequencing and analysis were used to determine serotypes and sequence types (STs) and evaluate antibiotic resistance- and virulence-related genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined in AST dishes via the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The prevalent serotypes in the IPD patients were 14, 6A, and 23F, and the prevalent serotypes in the NIPD patients were 19F and 6A. A significant difference in the proportion of patients with serotype 14 was noted between the two groups. A total of 23 STs were identified and classified into 13 different GPSC lineages, including 4 novel STs (ST18449, ST18451, ST18464 and ST18466) and 1 novel allele (ddl1209). According to the interpretation breakpoints for non-meningitis infections, the resistance/nonsusceptibility rates of invasive isolates were as follows: penicillin (0.0%/8.3%), amoxicillin (0.0%/0.0%), cefotaxime (8.3%/16.6%), ceftriaxone (8.3%/8.3%), and cefepime (0.0%/8.3%). The resistance/nonsusceptibility rates of invasive isolates according to the meningitis breakpoints were as follows: penicillin (100.0%), cefotaxime (16.7%/33.4%), ceftriaxone (8.3%/50.0%), and cefepime (8.3%/66.7%). All the isolates were susceptible to rifampicin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin. In addition, the characteristics of the antibiotic resistance-related genes and virulence genes of serotype 19F were significantly different from those of the other serotypes.

Using inverse probability treatment weighting, we examined the effects of adjunctive macrolides on 30-day all-cause mortality, time to hospital discharge, and changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. RESULTS: There was no evidence of an association between adjunctive macrolides and 30-day mortality (marginal odds ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.75-1.47] for amoxicillin with vs. without macrolide; 1.12 [0.93-1.34] for co-amoxiclav with vs. without macrolide); and no evidence of a difference in time to discharge (restricted mean days lost +1.76 days [-1.66, +5.19] for amoxicillin, +0.44 days [-1.63, +2.51] for co-amoxiclav). Macrolide use was not associated with SOFA score decreases. Results were consistent across severity sub-groups and sensitivity analyses with missing covariates imputed.

This study aimed to characterize the sputum microbiota of TB patients before and after the intensive phase of anti-TB treatment and assess changes in bacterial diversity and antibiotic resistance profiles. METHODS: A total of 162 patients with TB (128 males, 34 females; age range 18-82 years) provided sputum samples at baseline, of which 72 provided follow-up sputum after two months of intensive phase treatment. Sputum samples were cultured on standard agar plates, and distinct colonies were identified by Gram staining and bio-typing using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of the identified Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was performed using the Kirby-Bauer method according to the CLSI guidelines. RESULTS: At baseline, 209 bacterial isolates were recovered, dominated by Gram-positive bacteria (GPB), particularly Streptococcus oralis (19.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (13.9%). After treatment, the isolation rate significantly decreased (from 129% to 95.8%; p = 0.000002), with a shift towards Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) dominated by E. coli. High rates of antibiotic resistance were observed for both the GNB and GPB, notably to ampicillin (86.7%), tetracycline (74%), amoxicillin (70.3%), and sulfamethoxazole (63%) for GNP, and PEN (76.9%) for the GPB. 53% of S. aureus isolates were phenotypic Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 57.7% of suspected extended-spectrum Beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers were confirmed positive, predominantly carrying the blaCTX-M-1 gene.

This research was aimed to investigate the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella enterica in milk, milking environments, milkers' hands, and diarrheic patients in Wolaita Sodo, Ethiopia. METHODS: We collected 644 samples from 106 dairy farms that include direct milk from cow, bulk tank milk, milkers' hand swabs, teat surfaces swabs, farm floors swabs, milk storage containers swabs, collectors' bulk milk, retailers' bulk milk, and stool from diarrheic patients. Salmonella enterica was isolated using standard microbiological methods (culture-based detection, serology and PCR), and antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method against 14 antimicrobials. RESULTS: The overall occurrence of Salmonella enterica was 1.86% (12/644). The detection rate was 2.06% (7/339: 95% CI: 1.0-4.20) along the milk supply chain, 1.94% (2/103:95% CI: 0.53-6.81) in diarrheic outpatients and 1.49% (3/202: 95% CI: 0.51-4.27) in the milking environments. Relatively, higher contamination rate (6%, 3/50; 95% CI: 2.06-16.22) was observed in milk samples collected from milk collectors. The isolates exhibit higher resistance to clindamycin (100%), erythromycin (100%), vancomycin (100%), amoxicillin (100%), ceftazidime (100%), and ampicillin (75%). Of the isolates, 92%, 83% and 67% were susceptible to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and Trimethoprim, respectively. All the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). CONCLUSIONS: The study findings showed the occurrence of a considerable proportion of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella enterica across all sample sources, indicating potential transmission risks between cattle and humans via milk, and the milking environment. The alarming multidrug-resistant strains limit treatment options and complicate pathogen control. To prevent transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistant pathogen, proper hygiene practices, public education, and antimicrobial stewardship are essential. These measures will help ensure the safety of milk and dairy products. Further research on genetic relatedness among isolates, quantifying public health risks of milk consumption, and cost-effective intervention options is needed to reduce Salmonella-related morbidity and mortality.","[('foodborne illness', 'DISEASE'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cattle', 'DISEASE'), ('Salmonella-related', 'DISEASE')]"

This study isolated and characterized five endophytic fungi from Grewia lasiocarpa E. Mey. Ex Harv. and evaluated their in vitro antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Five [Aspergillus fumigatus (MK243397.1), A. fumigatus (MK243451.1), Penicillium raistrickii (MK243492.1), P. spinulosum (MK243479.1), Meyerozyma guilliermondii (MK243634.1)] of the 22 isolated endophytic fungi had inhibitory activity (62.5-1000 microg/mL) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The antioxidant activities were 66.5% and 98.4% for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), respectively. In silico evaluation of the phytochemicals of the extract (containing majorly n-hexadecanoic acid) was performed against penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) implicated in the broad clinical resistance of MRSA to conventional beta-lactams. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation analyses revealed that the phytosterol constituents of the extract, especially dehydroergosterol (-46.28 kcal/mol), had good stability (4.35 A) and compactness (35.08 A) with PBP2a relative to the unbound PBP2a and amoxicillin-PBP2a complex during the 100 ns simulation period, reinforcing them as putative leads that may be developed as viable alternatives to beta-lactams against infections caused by MRSA. However, the prediction that dehydroergosterol lacks oral bioavailability with poor water solubility suggests that it could benefit from structural optimization for improved druggability. Hence, isolating and derivatizing dehydroergosterol for subsequent evaluation against PBP2a in vitro and in vivo is highly recommended.","[('methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('ferric', 'CHEMICAL'), ('n-hexadecanoic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('phytosterol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"
39714147,2025,"Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) presents significant clinical challenges. This study evaluated the synergistic effects of a beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitor combination against Mab and explored the underlying mechanisms. Synergy was assessed through MIC tests and time-kill studies, and binding affinities of nine beta-lactams and BLIs to eight target receptors (L,D-transpeptidases [LDT] 1-5, D,D-carboxypeptidase, penicillin-binding protein [PBP] B, and PBP-lipo) were assessed using mass spectrometry and kinetic studies. Thermal stability and morphological changes were determined. Imipenem demonstrated high binding affinity to LDTs and PBPs, with extremely low inhibition constants (K(i)(,app); </=0.002 mg/L for LDT1-2, </=0.6 mg/L for PBPs), while cephalosporins, sulopenem, tebipenem, and amoxicillin exhibited moderate to low binding affinity. Durlobactam inactivated Bla(Mab) and LDT/PBPs more potently than avibactam. The K(i,app)s of durlobactam for PBP B, PBP-lipo, and LDT2 were below clinically achievable unbound concentrations, while avibactam's K(i,app) for LDT/PBPs exceeded the clinical concentrations. Single beta-lactam treatments resulted in minimal killing (~1 log(10) reduction). Although avibactam yielded no effect, combinations with avibactam showed a significant reduction (~4 log(10) CFU/mL). Durlobactam alone showed ~2 log(10) reduction, and when combined with imipenem or two beta-lactams, durlobactam achieved near-eradication of Mab, surpassing the current therapy (amikacin + clarithromycin + imipenem/cefoxitin). Inactivation of PBP-lipo by sulopenem, imipenem, durlobactam, and amoxicillin (with avibactam) led to morphological changes, showing filaments.

METHODS: The clinical presentation, investigations, treatment and long-term outcomes of 5 patients diagnosed with ALN was described and literature review was conducted by reviewing publications in PubMed using the keywords ""acute lobar nephronia"" and ""pediatric"". RESULTS: Three patients were males, aged 1 to 11 years. The primary complaint in all cases was fever, accompanied by significantly elevated inflammatory markers. Upon presentation, none of the patients exhibited pyuria on urinalysis, and all had sterile blood and urine cultures. Diagnosis was based on CT scans for three patients and renal sonography for two. Main findings included hyperechogenic renal parenchyma, and hypodense localized parenchyma. Treatment consisted of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, administered for 7 to 12 days and additional 1 week course with amoxicillin-clavulanate, resulting in similar defervescence times across all patients. None of the patients demonstrated recurrence and none had renal pathology upon repeated renal sonography and upon DMSA scintigraphy.

39711694,2024,"BACKGROUND: The effects of antibiotic use on children's gut microbiomes and resistomes are not well characterized in middle-income countries, where pediatric antibiotic consumption is exceptionally common. We characterized the effects of antibiotics commonly used by Peruvian children (i.e., amoxicillin, azithromycin, cefalexin, sulfa-trimethoprim) on gut diversity, genera, and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) abundance from 3-16 months. METHODS: This study included 54 children from a prospective cohort of enteric infections in peri-urban Lima, 2016-2019. Stool collected at 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, and 16 months underwent DNA extraction and short-read metagenomic sequencing. We profiled the taxonomy of stool metagenomes and assessed ARG abundance by aligning reads to the ResFinder database. We used daily surveillance data (40,662 observations) to tabulate the number of antibiotic courses consumed in the 30 days prior to stool sampling. Using linear mixed models, the association of recent antibiotic use with species richness, diversity, gut genera, and ARG abundance over time was examined. RESULTS: Most children were vaginally delivered (73%), received breastmilk almost daily over the study period, and belonged to socioeconomically diverse households. Amoxicillin, azithromycin, cefalexin, and sulfa-trimethoprim did not impact gut diversity or genera abundance. Azithromycin use significantly impacted ARGs from the macrolide, aminoglycoside, and folate pathway antagonist classes. Amoxicillin use significantly increased total ARGs. Antibiotics' effects on ARGs appeared to be independent of gut microbiome changes. CONCLUSION: Common antibiotics like amoxicillin and azithromycin may be key drivers of the gut resistome but not the microbiome during early childhood in this setting with frequent breastfeeding.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefalexin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('enteric infections', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefalexin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfa-trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('macrolide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycoside', 'CHEMICAL'), ('folate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39710669,2024,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection causes gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. The infection is typically acquired in childhood and persists throughout life. The major impediment to successful therapy is antibiotic resistance. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively assess the global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in pediatric H. pylori infection. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of publication databases that assessed H. pylori resistance rates to clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin, amoxicillin, and tetracycline in children. The WHO region classification was used to group pooled primary and secondary resistance estimates along with 95% confidence interval (CI). H. pylori antibiotic resistance rates were retrieved and combined with odds ratios (95% CI) to investigate the global prevalence and temporal trends. Subgroup analysis of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance was conducted by country, age groups, and susceptibility testing methods. RESULTS: Among 1417 records obtained initially, 152 studies were selected for eligibility assessment after applying exclusion criteria in multiple steps. Ultimately, 63 studies involving 15,953 individuals were included comprising data from 28 countries in 5 WHO regions. The primary resistance rates were metronidazole 35.3% (5482/15,529, 95% CI: 28.7-42.6), clarithromycin 32.6% (5071/15,555, 95% CI: 27.7-37.9), tetracycline 2.1% (148/7033, 95% CI: 1.3-3.6), levofloxacin 13.2% (1091/8271, 95% CI: 9.3-18.4), and amoxicillin 4.8% (495/10305, 95% CI: 2.5-8.8).

39710142,2025,"BACKGROUND: beta-lactams are crucial for anti-Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) therapy. Treating infections is challenging since MABC produces a class A beta-lactamase (Bla(Mab)), which is capable of hydrolyzing beta-lactams thus causing drug resistance. Diazabicyclooctane (DBO) beta-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) can inhibit Bla(Mab). FL058 is a novel DBO BLI; the anti-MABC activity of FL058 combined with beta-lactams remains unknown. METHODS: The activities of ten beta-lactams (imipenem, meropenem, faropenem, tebipenem, cefoxitin, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefdinir, cefuroxime, and amoxicillin) combined with three DBO BLIs (FL058, avibactam, and relebactam) toward two MABC reference strains were determined by broth microdilution assay. The anti-MABC activities of imipenem combined with three BLIs against 193 clinical isolates were also evaluated. The activity of imipenem combined with FL058 was also tested against intracellular MABC residing in macrophages and in a mouse model. Finally, the Bla(Mab) mutations in clinical isolates were analyzed using sequence alignment to determine whether Bla(Mab) mutations are associated with DBO BLIs sensitivity. RESULTS: FL058, avibactam and relebactam significantly increased the anti-MABC activity of beta-lactams, especially imipenem, against reference strains and clinical isolates. The anti-MABC activity of imipenem combined with FL058 was superior to its activity when combined with either avibactam or relebactam. The combination of imipenem and FL058 significantly reduced the numbers of intracellular organisms in cultured macrophages, and of viable bacteria in the lungs of MABC-infected mice. Rough morphotypes tended to be more resistant than smooth morphotype. A Bla(Mab) T141A mutation may reduce the susceptibility of MABC to imipenem-BLIs. CONCLUSION: The elevated anti-MABC activity exhibited by imipenem combined with FL058 suggests a potential new approach to treating MABC infections.","[('anti-Mycobacterium abscessus', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('faropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tebipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefoxitin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefepime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefdinir', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('avibactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('avibactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('avibactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"
39708826,2025,"BACKGROUND: Vonoprazan and amoxicillin (VA) dual therapy as a mainstream Helicobacter pylori regimen has gained momentum worldwide, but the optimum dosages remain unclear. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of VA dual therapy with 2 g amoxicillin or 3 g amoxicillin, and to assess the short-term effects of therapy on the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial at 12 centres in China. Individuals infected with H pylori, aged 18-70 years, and without previous eradication therapy were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (block size of six) to receive vonoprazan (20 mg twice a day) with either low-dose amoxicillin (1 g twice a day; LVA therapy) or high-dose amoxicillin (1 g three times a day; HVA therapy) for 14 days. Gastric biopsies were collected before treatment for detection of antibiotic resistance. Stool samples were collected at baseline, week 2, and week 8-10 for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The primary outcome was the eradication rate of H pylori, assessed by (13)C urea breath test, in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, adherence, antibiotic resistance, and alterations to the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome. The margin used to establish non-inferiority was -0.10. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05649709. FINDINGS: Between Feb 13, 2023, and Jan 25, 2024, 504 patients (204 [40%] male and 300 [60%] female; mean age 43 years [SD 13]) were randomly assigned to LVA therapy or HVA therapy (n=252 in each group). No infections were resistant to amoxicillin. The H pylori eradication rate was 85.3% (215 of 252; 95% CI 80.4 to 89.2) in the LVA group and 86.5% (218 of 252; 81.7 to 90.2) in the HVA group in the intention-to-treat analysis (p=0.70) and 88.8% (213 of 240; 84.1 to 92.2) and 92.4% (218 of 236; 88.3 to 95.1), respectively, in the per-protocol analysis (p=0.18). The efficacy of LVA was non-inferior to HVA in the intention-to-treat analysis (risk difference -1.2%, 95% CI -7.3 to 4.9, p=0.0022) and the per-protocol analysis (-3.6%, -9.0 to 1.7, p=0.0085). 31 (12%) patients in the LVA group and 43 (17%) patients in the HVA group reported adverse events. Adherence to therapy was 97% in the LVA group and 96% in the HVA group. The diversity of gut microbiota decreased after treatment but was restored to baseline at week 8-10 in both groups. The abundance of beta-lactam-related resistance genes was increased at week 2 after treatment, and was restored to pretreatment level at week 8-10 for the LVA group but not the HVA group. INTERPRETATION: LVA dual therapy was effective and non-inferior to HVA dual therapy as first-line treatment of H pylori infection and showed a non-lasting effect on the abundance of beta-lactam-related resistance genes. High amoxicillin dosage (eg, 3 g per day) is not required to achieve high cure rates with vonoprazan dual therapy.

A research gap demonstrates that many studies are required to use these nanocomposites for photodegradation of antibiotics. By providing a better grasp of the photocatalysis process, this review encourages scientists and researchers to develop an accurate and appropriate photocatalyst to reduce environmental risks. The main findings of this review article suggest that the cost-effective g-C(3)N(4)/MOx-based nanocomposites exhibit excellent photodegradation properties, high charge transfer, broadening light response, and charge separation. They promote enhanced charge transportation, superior electron conductivity, high redox capability, and suppressing charge recombination rate. The photodegradation mechanism involves various reactive oxygen species (ROSs), including superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and holes which promotes the photocatalysis process.

DATA: Articles relating to odontogenic facial swellings in children and adolescents aged 0-16 years were included. Articles in which paediatric data could not be differentiated from adult data or where the age of participants were unknown were excluded. Also excluded were guidelines that did not provide age-specific recommendations. Resources that exclusively focused on localised odontogenic infections, Ludwig's Angina, neck infections, orbital cellulitis and sepsis and those that pooled data related to odontogenic facial swelling and other medical or dental conditions were excluded. SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE were searched with no date restrictions. Google Advanced Search was used to identify grey literature. STUDY SELECTION: Of the 5251 identified articles, 22 primary studies and 32 secondary sources of evidence were included after full text review. No articles evaluated the use of specific diagnostic criteria used to support antibiotic prescribing. Three studies evaluated the effectiveness of antibiotic regimes in the management of odontogenic facial swellings in young people. Antibiotic regimes varied; oral amoxicillin was the most frequently recommended first-line therapy, followed by phenoxymethylpenicillin. Most articles recommended antibiotics as an adjunct to dental treatment. The weight of the child, penicillin allergy/ hypersensitivity and clinical response to therapy were commonly reported to influence antibiotic prescribing. Inconsistencies between guidelines were identified which is likely due to a lack of evidence regarding the use of antibiotics in the paediatric population.

Appropriate antimicrobial therapy is essential for treatment this zoonotic disease because of the rapid deterioration of systemic symptoms at disease onset; however, antimicrobial resistance of animal bite-associated Capnocytophaga spp. has not been fully investigated. We sought to understand the antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of resistance genes among Capnocytophaga sp. isolates obtained from dogs and cats. METHOD: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of nine antibiotics for a total of 57 isolates belonging to 6 species (C. canimorsus, C. cynodegmi, C. canis, C. felis, C. stomatis, and C. catalasegens) were assayed using E-test. Resistance genes were detected using polymerase chain reaction, nucleotide sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: The MICs of penicillin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, clindamycin, minocycline, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin were high for some isolates. The MICs of imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were low for all isolates. Known resistance genes bla(cfxA2), bla(OXA-347), emrF, and tetQ were detected using polymerase chain reaction. Mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA was also detected. Cst-1, a previously unreported gene, was identified using whole-genome analysis of two C. stomatis isolates. CST-1 was proposed as a class A, subclass A2, beta-lactamase based on amino acid sequence and phylogenetic relationship. In recombination experiments, CST-1 inactivated penicillin and first- and second-generation cephems; however, sulbactam inhibited it.

39704543,2025,"Beta-lactam antibiotics are the most applied antimicrobials in human and veterinarian health care. Hence, beta-lactam resistance is a major health problem. Gene amplification of AmpC beta-lactamase is a main contributor to de novo beta-lactam resistance in Escherichia coli. However, the time course of amplification and the accompanying DNA mutations are unclear. Here, we study the progression of ampC amplification and ampC promoter mutations during the evolution of resistance induced by stepwise increasing amoxicillin concentrations. AmpC promoter mutations occurred by day 2, while the approximately eight-fold amplification occurred after more than 6 days of amoxicillin exposure. The combination of the amplification and the promoter mutations increased the ampC mRNA level by an average factor of 200 after 22 days. An IS1 insertion is identified in the amplification junction after resistance induction in the wild type (WT) and the ampC gene complementation strain (CompA), but not in ∆ampC, suggesting that the amplification depends on mobile genetic element transposition. In order to elucidate the correlation between gene mutations and ampC amplification, the DNA mutations acquired during resistance evolution by the WT, ∆ampC, and CompA were analyzed. Compared to evolved ∆ampC, several resistance-causing mutations are absent in evolved WT, while more mutations accumulated in stress response. The amoxicillin-resistant ∆ampC did not show amplification of the fragment around the original ampC position but exhibited a large duplication or triplication at another position, suggesting the essential role of the duplicated genes in resistance development.IMPORTANCEAmoxicillin is the most used antimicrobial against bacterial infections. DNA fragments containing ampC are amplified upon prolonged and stepwise increasing exposure to amoxicillin, causing resistance. These ampC-containing fragments have been identified in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase plasmids, which are considered the main cause of beta-lactam resistance. In this study, we document the time course of two important factors for ampC transcription enhancement, ampC amplification and ampC promoter mutations, during de novo amoxicillin resistance evolution. We propose that the transposon IS1 contributes to the amplification ampC region, that the sigma factor 70 regulates ampC overexpression, and that these combined form the backbone of a putative mechanism for ampC amplification.","[('Beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-resistant', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Improved methods for genomic analysis, particularly the development of genome-wide association studies, have facilitated the identification of genomic risk factors for DILI, but, to date, there are only two main examples, liver injury caused by amoxicillin-clavulanate (AC) and by flucloxacillin, where genetic risk factors causing the injury have been identified and replicated with understanding of the underlying mechanism.

The majority of genetic risk factors identified to date are specific human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and evidence that these alleles preferentially present self-peptides inappropriately to T cells in the liver has been obtained. Non-HLA genes also contribute to genetic susceptibility, both as co-factors in T-cell responses and, in the case of isoniazid-only, drug metabolism. Polygenic risk scores to predict DILI have been developed, both a simple score that predicts AC injury and complex scores that may be applied to DILI more generally and provide evidence that additional risk factors other than HLA genes exist.","[('hepatotoxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('liver injury', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('liver injury', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('liver injury', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('flucloxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('liver injury', 'DISEASE'), ('self-peptides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE')]"
39703397,2024,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the characteristics of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) collected in a university hospital. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of ADRs spontaneously reported in the Hospital Pharmacovigilance Program database (RutiRAM) over a 13-year period was conducted. The analysis included a description of ADRs [System Organ Class (SOC)] and their seriousness, the drugs involved [level 1 of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System], drug-drug interactions, medication errors, drugs 'under additional monitoring', positive rechallenge, and the 'pharmacovigilance interest' of ADRs. An ADR was considered of 'pharmacovigilance interest' when it was serious, and/or produced sequelae, and/or affected the paediatric population, and/or when the suspected drug was 'under additional monitoring'. Additionally, an exploratory analysis for bivariate associations through an automated method was performed. RESULTS: A total of 2,148 spontaneous ADRs were registered in the RutiRAM database, with 92.5% recorded by medical doctors. The mean age of cases was 59.2 years (SD 20.9), range 1 day-99 years; 5.7% were paediatric, 46.2% adults, and 48.1% elderly. The drugs most often involved were anti-infectives (ATC group J), mainly amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. 'Blood system disorders' were the most frequent SOC ADRs, and skin rashes were the most frequent ADRs. The 63.2% of ADRs were considered of 'pharmacovigilance interest'. Almost half of ADRs were hospital-acquired, and these were related to medication error; serious ADRs were related to drug-drug interactions and elderly patients, and involved drugs 'under additional monitoring' were related to younger ones. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to overview of ADRs reported in an HPVP over more than a decade. Almost two-thirds of the ADRs collected in the RutiRAM database are of sufficient quality to be classified as 'pharmacovigilance interest', and thus can contribute to signal detection and the issuing of drug alerts by pharmacovigilance systems. Analysing ADRs in hospitals contributes to patient safety by implementing relevant actions to prevent medication errors or ADRs, some of which can be applied to other centres.","[('adverse drug reactions', 'DISEASE'), ('ADRs', 'DISEASE'), ('ADR', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ADRs', 'DISEASE')]"
39697909,2024,"Gallbladder rupture, though rare, is a serious complication often arising from choledocholithiasis and subsequent interventions such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In this case, the patient presented with acute choledocholithiasis and underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction, followed by placement of a fully covered metal stent in the common bile duct (CBD). While the use of covered stents is appropriate, it is important to note that these stents can obstruct the cystic duct orifice in patients with a gallbladder. This occurs in more than 33% of patients with a low cystic duct junction, leading to obstructive acute cholecystitis, as seen in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) or distal cholangiocarcinoma who receive metal biliary stents. In this case, the patient developed a liver abscess following a gallbladder rupture, likely due to the stent obstructing the cystic duct. The liver abscess was managed with percutaneous drainage, and cultures grew Streptococcus anginosus, a common pathogen in hepatobiliary infections. The patient was treated with IV piperacillin-tazobactam, followed by oral amoxicillin-clavulanate for a 4-6 week course. Additionally, portal vein thrombosis, a known complication of severe infection, was identified and treated with anticoagulation. This case highlights the need for careful stent selection and possible prophylactic cholecystectomy in patients with a functioning gallbladder to prevent post-ERCP complications like cholecystitis and abscess formation. Early diagnosis, timely drainage, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are critical to managing such complex hepatobiliary conditions.","[('Gallbladder rupture', 'DISEASE'), ('choledocholithiasis', 'DISEASE'), ('acute choledocholithiasis', 'DISEASE'), ('sphincterotomy and stone', 'DISEASE'), ('CBD', 'CHEMICAL'), ('low cystic duct junction', 'DISEASE'), ('obstructive acute cholecystitis', 'DISEASE'), ('pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma', 'DISEASE'), ('PDAC', 'DISEASE'), ('cholangiocarcinoma', 'DISEASE'), ('liver abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('gallbladder rupture', 'DISEASE'), ('liver abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('hepatobiliary infections', 'DISEASE'), ('piperacillin-tazobactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vein thrombosis', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('post-ERCP complications like cholecystitis', 'DISEASE'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE')]"
39697365,2024,"Due to consumer demand, many conventional poultry farms are now growing poultry without antibiotics or synthetic chemicals. In addition to this, pasture/organic poultry farms have increased significantly in the USA, and they are also antibiotic- and chemical-free. According to recent reports, both antibiotic-free conventional and pasture poultry farmers are facing the re-emergence of bacterial diseases. Bacterial diseases cause higher mortality rates in birds and lead to non-profitable poultry farming. This study investigated the prevalence of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum biovars Gallinarum (S. Gallinarum), the causative agent of fowl typhoid, and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum biovars Pullorum (S. Pullorum), the causative agent of pullorum disease, within integrated crop-livestock/pasture farm environments and their processed products. Specifically, the study focused on both the pre-harvest period, which includes the conditions and practices on the farm before the crops and livestock are harvested, and the post-harvest period, which encompasses the handling, processing, and storage of the products after harvest. A total of 1286 samples were collected from six farms and adjacent 13 markets to determine the prevalence of S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum by using both microbiological culture and molecular techniques, specifically PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the agar dilution method for the recommended antibiotics as described in the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). S. Pullorum was detected in 11 samples (2.7%), while S. Gallinarum was found in six samples (1.5%) out of a total of 403 samples at the pre-harvest level. At the post-harvest level, only S. Gallinarum was identified in 14 meat samples out of 883(1.6%) recovered from samples collected from retail markets. Antibiogram showed S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum to be highly resistant to cephradine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, streptomycin, and ampicillin. This data demonstrates that both S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum are commonly present in farm poultry environments as well as the products sold in the markets, which warrants implementation of regular surveillance and monitoring programmes, as well as potentially requiring future control strategies to reduce S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum transmission.","[('Bacterial diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('typhoid', 'DISEASE'), ('pullorum disease', 'DISEASE'), ('post-harvest', 'CHEMICAL'), ('post-harvest', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephradine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('streptomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39697296,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance is a major global public health concern, especially in low-resource settings. In low- and middle-income countries, the existing evidence about antimicrobial resistance in drinking water is inconsistence and not comprehensive. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of antimicrobial resistance profiles of Escherichia coli from drinking water in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: This study was conducted using comprehensive literature searches using various databases such as PubMed, Scientific Direct, HINARI, and Google Scholar. Data extraction was performed using Microsoft Excel and exported to STATA 14/SE software for analysis. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute's quality appraisal tool to ensure the quality of the included studies. A random effects model was employed to estimate the pooled prevalence. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were also conducted in this study. RESULTS: The study found that the pooled prevalence of Escherichia coli isolates in drinking water was 37.94% (95% CI: 26.73-49.13). The prevalence of multidrug resistance was 43.65% (95% CI: 31.15-56.15). Regarding specific antimicrobials, the pooled resistance levels of Escherichia coli were 54.65% (95% CI: 41.35-67.96) against contrimoxazole, followed by 48.64% (95% CI: -3.6-101) against amoxicillin and 48% (95% CI: -18.1-114.2) against cefuroxime. CONCLUSION: The findings indicated a significant prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli isolated from drinking water and its multidrug resistance. To address this issue, it recommends focusing on improving basic hygiene and sanitation practices and enhancing water and wastewater treatment systems.

39696557,2024,"BACKGROUND: Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for Nocardia spp. is essential to initiate effective antibiotic therapy. Currently, the only recommended technique is the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) by microdilution. This method can be tedious to perform, despite the availability of ready-to-use plates. Herein, the aim was to determine the critical inhibition diameters specific to Nocardia spp. METHODS: MICs of 134 Nocardia isolates were determined by microdilution. Interpretative categories (Susceptible/Intermediate/Resistant) were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. In parallel, disk diffusion DST was performed. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the inhibition diameter value that best discriminated between susceptible and non-susceptible strains (intermediate/resistant). The category agreement (CA), the rate of major (maj) and very major (vmj) discrepancies between microdilution and disk diffusion method was calculated. RESULTS: For tobramycin, the critical diameter of 19 mm (diameter </= 19 mm = resistant strain; diameter > 19 mm = susceptible strain) provided a CA of 98.5%, 0.0% vmj, and 2.9% maj discrepancies, reaching strictly the acceptable performance criteria defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For amikacin, the critical diameter of 25 mm (diameter </= 25 mm = resistant strain; diameter > 25 mm = susceptible strain) provided a CA of 98.5%, 0.0% vmj, and 1.5% maj discrepancies. For imipenem, excluding N. farcinica and N. cyriacigeorgica, the critical diameter of 29 mm (diameter </= 29 mm = resistant strain; diameter > 29 mm = susceptible strain), provided a CA of 98.6%, 0.0% vmj, and 0.0% maj discrepancies. Despite an estimated vmj rate 0.0%, the 95%-confident-interval exceeded the FDA criteria due to an insufficient number of amikacin/imipenem-resistant strains. For other tested antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, cotrimoxazole, linezolid), the FDA criteria were not reached. CONCLUSIONS: Although the FDA criteria were mostly unmet, disk diffusion DST was suitable to accurately categorize Nocardia isolates into interpretative categories for the aminoglycosides and imipenem only, excluding species N. farcinica and N. cyriacigeorgica.","[('non-susceptible', 'CHEMICAL'), ('intermediate/resistant', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tobramycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amikacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('moxifloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cotrimoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('linezolid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycosides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('imipenem', 'CHEMICAL')]"

This study aims to provide a snapshot of susceptibility trends for pathogens on Curacao, an island in the southern Caribbean. METHODS: We analyzed susceptibility data of bacterial pathogens isolated from samples submitted from patients attending general practitioners, outpatient clinics and those who were hospitalized between January 2018 and December 2023. Samples originating from blood, urine, genital tract, soft tissue, and lungs were included. Susceptibility testing was performed by VITEK2 according using the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing criteria. RESULTS: In total, 13,528 patients contributed to 22,876 first isolates. Of all infections in adults with Staphylococcus aureus, 14% (95% confidence interval 10-18%) were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in blood, and up to 27% (20-35%) in soft-tissue cultures. For Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, resistance levels were up to 27% (95% CI 22-32%) for cefuroxime and up to 18% (95% CI 18-28%) for third-generation cephalosporins. The addition of gentamicin to empirical therapy with cefuroxime increased coverage only moderately, especially in K. pneumoniae (16%, 95% CI 12-20%). Resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was up to 47% (95% CI 43-50%), to ciprofloxacin 34% (95% CI 31-37%) and to cotrimoxazole 37% (95% CI 34-39) in urine cultures from outpatients. In contrast, low levels of carbapenem resistant Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed.

39696058,2024,"To enhance the current clinical understanding and improve the diagnosis and treatment of Actinotignum schaalii infections, we have presented here a report of the case of recurrent infections at a periumbilical scar, induced by Actinotignum schaalii and complicated by abscess formation in a 50-year-old woman with persistent festering at the site of a periumbilical scar after laparoscopy 9 years ago, with subsequent ruptures over the past 2 years. Physical examination revealed a radial fold scar with localized redness and slight swelling of the skin below the navel. Although no significant increase in the local skin temperature was noted, tenderness was present. A rupture at the site was also observed, and gentle compression produced a small amount of odorless and yellowish viscous pus. Anerobic culturing of the pus for 3 days revealed gray-white, non-hemolytic, spore-free, gram-positive, slightly curved rod-shaped bacteria. These bacteria were identified as A. schaalii using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The patient was subsequently treated with a 1-month course of oral amoxicillin, combined with debridement and drainage. Her condition improved with regular dressing changes. However, during follow-up 6-month later, the patient presented with a recurrence of the local infection at the scar site, again accompanied by abscess formation and rupture. Notably, the wound size was smaller, and after a 1-week treatment with silver ion, without any systemic antibiotic administration, her condition improved.

39695558,2024,"BACKGROUND: Digital solutions can help monitor medication safety in children who are often excluded in clinical trials. The lack of reliable safety data often leads to either under- or over-dose of medications during clinical management which make them either not responding well to treatment or susceptible to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). AIM: This study investigated ADR signalling techniques to detect serious ADRs in Malaysian children aged from birth to 12 years old using an electronic ADRs' database. METHODS: Four techniques (Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS)) were tested on ADR reports submitted to the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency between 2016 and 2020. Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the techniques were compared. RESULTS: A total of 31 medicine-Important Medical Event pairs were found and examined among the 3152 paediatric ADR reports. Three techniques (PRR, ROR, MGPS) signalled oculogyric crisis and dystonia for metoclopramide. BCPNN and MGPS signalled angioedema for paracetamol, amoxicillin and ibuprofen. Similar performances were found for PRR, ROR and BCPNN (sensitivity of 12%, specificity of 100%, PPV of 100% and NPV of 21%).

39695035,2025,"Amoxicillin (AMX) is a common antibiotic used in both human and veterinary medicine in order to both cure and avoid bacterial infections. Traces of AMX have been found in ground and surface water, urban effluents, water, and wastewater treatment facilities due to its widespread use. The level of hazard and disposal of this class of micropollutants is the reason for concern. Advanced technology is required since conventional wastewater treatment plants are ineffective at eliminating these emerging contaminants. Electrochemical oxidation is a promising method of treating wastewater, which uses electrogenerated radicals to mineralize organic pollutants. This work investigated the detailed process mechanism for AMX degradation utilizing a low-cost, thin, flexible graphite sheet with lower AMX concentrations, initial pH value, voltage, electrolyte concentration, and wastewater matrix. The degradation of AMX by in situ generated hydroxyl radicals is a function of applied voltage and follows pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The removal efficiencies of AMX have been achieved up to 99% within 3 h. Moreover, intermediate by-products have been identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and a plausible pathway has been proposed.

SAMPLE SELECTION: The cohort included 269,003 patients. In terms of participants, this sample consisted of Veteran Affairs Dental patients, who attended for a dental extraction between 01/01/2015- 31/12/2019. The intervention and comparator was whether or not patients had received an antibiotic prescription prior to their extraction, with the primary outcome a specified post-extraction complication (oral infection, dry socket or fever within 7 days of the extraction). Data was collected on patient demographics, medical history, and details regarding the extraction. DATA ANALYSIS: Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association between antibiotic prescription prior to extraction and outcomes, alongside a sensitivity analysis that excluded antibiotics prescribed by a medical provider. RESULTS: The cohort included 269003 patients, who attended 385,880 dental visits. During 122,810 visits (31.8%), patients received antibiotics prior to extraction, with amoxicillin the most frequently prescribed. Antibiotics were more commonly prescribed in those who received a surgical extraction. In total, 3387 patients experienced a complication. Of these patients, 1272 had received antibiotics, compared with 2115 who had not. The regression analysis determined that diabetes was a statistically significant modifier of an association.

Methods: We conducted a multi-centered, prospective, observational study (clinical trial registration: NCT05091931) with Western Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval (20214705). Adult subjects were split between the M-PCR/P-AST (n = 250) and SUC arms (n = 135). Treatment details were determined by clinician and subject surveys. Differences in prescribed antibiotics were compared using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Results: There was no significant difference in the overall use of ""access"" antibiotics (p = 1.0) or first-line drugs (p = 0.4483) between M-PCR/P-AST and SUC. Nitrofurantoin (p = 0.0172) and metronidazole (p = 0.0309) were more frequently used with M-PCR/P-AST, while amoxicillin/clavulanate (p = 0.0008), cefuroxime (p = 0.0378), and ertapenem (p = 0.0378) were more frequently used with SUC.

Breast milk is recognized as a major driver of the structure and dynamics of an infant's GM. In addition to nutritious and prebiotic compounds, milk contains a microbiota that is shaped by several maternal factors, including gut microorganisms and medications. However, the impact of the latter on the milk microbiota is still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of amoxicillin on the milk microbiota and GM of lactating Gottingen Minipigs sows, a promising model for studying medication transfer during lactation. METHODS: Three sows were given amoxicillin (7 mg/kg/day) for three weeks starting from the second week after farrowing. Fecal and milk samples were collected before and after treatment and profiled by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: Gottingen Minipigs' milk microbiota showed similarities to that of humans and conventional sows, with minor compositional shifts after treatment.

39682475,2024,"Pakistan has a large, intensive broiler production industry, where antimicrobials are extensively used for both therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. Monitoring antimicrobial use (AMU) at the farm level is crucial to guide interventions for antimicrobial stewardship. The objective of this study was to comprehensively quantify AMU on commercial broiler farms in Pakistan using different metrics. Data on on-farm AMU (both therapeutic and prophylactic) were collected from intensive commercial broiler farms in Punjab, Pakistan. AMU was quantified using four different metrics: treatment incidence (TI) based on defined daily dose (TIDDD(vetPK)), TI based on defined course dose (TIDCD(vetPK)), TI based on used daily dose (TIUDD(vetPK)), and mg/kg biomass. The median TIDDD(vetPK), TIDCD(vetPK), TIUDD(vetPK), and mg/kg biomass values were 57.7 (7.5-257.9), 13.3 (1.8-52.5), 75.3 (21.1-182.9), and 301 (46.8-1009.6), respectively, based on 741 group treatments given at 100 participating farms with 225 flocks. About 34% treatments were administered for therapeutic purposes, with 66% administered as prophylaxis. A total of 41 active substances, distributed across 17 antimicrobial classes, were identified from 139 commercial antimicrobial products used. The most commonly used active substances (AS), out of total 741 group treatments, were colistin (polymyxins) at 17%, enrofloxacin (quinolones) at 8%, neomycin (aminoglycosides) and amoxicillin (aminopenicillins) at 7% each, and procaine penicillin (NS penicillins) and streptomycin (aminoglycosides) at 6% each. According to the WHO categorization, 57% of the used AS were found to be critically important antimicrobials (CIAs) for human medicine. As many as 30% of treatments were administered in the first week (13% on the first day of production), and the main indication was prophylaxis for early chick mortality, followed by 21% in week 5, with main indication being feed supplements for necrotic enteritis. The average weight at slaughtering was 2.25 kg, gained after an average of 44 days of the production cycle. The alarmingly high AMU in Pakistani broiler production emphasizes the urgent need to reduce AMU, particularly involving CIAs and the prophylactic use of antimicrobials. This can be achieved by improving farm management practices and strengthening regulatory oversight to enable prudent antimicrobial use, eventually reducing the risk of AMR.","[('colistin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polymyxins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('enrofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('quinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycosides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminopenicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('procaine penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('streptomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycosides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CIAs', 'DISEASE'), ('necrotic enteritis', 'DISEASE'), ('CIAs', 'DISEASE')]"

The objective of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of healthcare personnel with regard to the management of diarrhea. METHODS: a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among health care givers in health facilities in four (4) health districts (HDs) of Logone and Chari Department of Far North Cameroon in 2016. Consenting participants, selected exhaustively in the health facilities, responded individually to a semi-structured questionnaire administered face to face on a smartphone Open Data Kit (ODK) format. Statistical analyses of the data allowed us to highlight frequencies and proportions of variables such as the definition of diarrhea, the causes of diarrhea, diagnostic techniques and methods, and the management of these diseases. RESULTS: a total of 77 professionals participated in this study, of whom 56% were nurse assistants, 22% were nurses, and 5% were physicians; 78% of them knew the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of diarrhea. Twenty-two (29%) reported having IMCI and 82% of them practiced it. Seventy-seven (100%) reported they administered a rehydration solution according to the dehydration status of the first-line patient. Metronidazole (23%), amoxicillin (17%), and cotrimoxazole (14%) are the antimicrobials frequently prescribed in children less than 5 years of age. CONCLUSION: health care providers in Logone and Chari Department have different opinions regarding diarrheal diseases as well as on the management of its diseases.

In Bangladesh, the Buriganga River is heavily polluted with multiple antibiotics, which can lead to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. In this study, we performed the first investigation of seasonal variations in the occurrence and spatial distribution of 29 antibiotics in the Buriganga River, Bangladesh, from wet season (August 2019) and dry season (February 2020). We also evaluate the potential environmental and resistance risks related to antibiotic contamination. The concentrations of metronidazole (9.1-970 ng L(-1)), sulfadiazine (below the limit of detection (<LOD)-790 ng L(-1)), and levofloxacin (<LOD-710 ng L(-1)) were the highest, and metronidazole, amoxicillin, and doxycycline were detected in all samples during both seasons. The number of antibiotics detected, and their overall concentrations were higher during the dry season (February) than during the wet season (August). Ecological risk assessment using risk quotients (RQs) indicated that levofloxacin (maximum RQ = 90), amoxicillin (58), and ciprofloxacin (21) could pose a high risk to aquatic organisms, whereas sulfamethazine, trimethoprim, doxycycline, and lincomycin pose a medium risk. The levels of seven antibiotics, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, and metronidazole exceeded the antibiotic resistance thresholds.

This study aimed to determine syphilis treatments in Japan and investigate the impact of the new intramuscular penicillin formulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Japanese Administrative Claims Database from January 2016 to September 2023 were used to identify patients diagnosed with syphilis, and the types and annual trends of antimicrobials prescribed were investigated. Furthermore, the characteristics of patients prescribed an intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin G were compared with those of patients who were not. RESULTS: Overall, 7867 patients were included in the analysis (81 %, male; 5.4 % positive for human immunodeficiency virus). Seventy-five percent of patients were diagnosed with syphilis in facilities with 0-19 beds. Annual trends showed oral amoxicillin as the most prescribed drug to 80 % of patients throughout the study period. In 2023, 10.6 % of patients received a prescription for an intramuscular penicillin formulation. Compared with those who did not receive this treatment, those who received it tended to have fewer clinic visits over 1 month (p = 0.0256).

39672059,2025,"Amoxicillin is a widely used antibiotic globally, and its pervasive environmental presence poses significant risks to human health and ecosystems. Notably, prenatal amoxicillin exposure (PAmE) may have long-term neurodevelopmental toxicity for offspring. In this study, we investigated the lasting effects of PAmE on depressive-like behaviors in offspring rats, emphasizing the biological mechanisms mediated by changes in gut microbiota and its metabolite, myristic acid. Our results showed that PAmE significantly disrupted the gut microbiota composition in offspring, particularly through the reduction of Lachnospiraceae, leading to decreased levels of myristic acid. This disruption hindered the N-myristoylation of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), impaired the normal degradation of the stimulator of interferon genes protein, inhibited autophagic processes, and promoted M1 polarization of microglia, ultimately leading to depressive-like behaviors in the offspring. Remarkably, supplementation with Lachnospira or myristic acid effectively reversed the PAmE-induced neurodevelopmental and behavioral abnormalities, alleviating depressive-like symptoms. This study reveals how PAmE affects offspring neurodevelopment and behavior through gut microbiota and myristic acid, highlighting the crucial role of the gut-brain axis in the modulation of depressive symptoms. Supplementing Lachnospira or myristic acid could represent a novel strategy to mitigate PAmE-induced fetal-originated depression, providing new biological evidence and potential therapeutic avenues.","[('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neurodevelopmental toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('depressive-like behaviors', 'DISEASE'), ('myristic acid', 'DISEASE'), ('depressive-like behaviors', 'DISEASE'), ('neurodevelopmental and behavioral abnormalities', 'DISEASE'), ('depressive', 'DISEASE'), ('depression', 'DISEASE')]"

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to isolate, characterize, and determine the antibiogram of Enterobacteriaceae contaminating household kitchen sponges in Abakaliki metropolis, Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 household kitchen sponges were randomly collected from 50 different households in Abakaliki metropolis. The samples were analyzed with standard microbiological techniques and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: In total, 28 (56%) out of the 50 kitchen sponges were positive for Salmonella spp. (10), Klebsiella spp. (7), and Escherichia coli (11). In general, isolates were multidrug-resistant with high resistance frequencies (43.7%-100%) to carbapenems, aztreonam, tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. There was no statistically significant difference in the antimicrobial resistance frequencies between the Enterobacteriaceae isolates (P = 0.982). The multiple antibiotics resistance index values of isolates ranged from 0.4 to 0.8.

Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the isolates were closely related, with a maximum of 39 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences in the core genome. All Armenian isolates carried the integrative and conjugative element ICEKp4, which bears the yersiniabactin locus, and shared a common evolutionary origin, diverging around 2005 (95% CI: 1999 to 2011). Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed resistance to several antibiotics, including ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefepime, ceftazidime, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, and chloramphenicol. Specifically, isolates designated as ARM03 and ARM06 were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, ARM04 and ARM05 had intermediate resistance to both piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem, and ARM03 showed intermediate resistance to amikacin. We further identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in four Armenian isolates, including bla(OXA-1), bla(TEM-1D), bla(SHV-28), dfrA14, tet(A), sul2, qnrB1, aac(6 )-Ib-cr, strA, strB and the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene bla(CTX-M-15).

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are the only management strategy for UTIs in ambulators and hospital stays. Due to the ongoing emergence of antibiotic resistance among uropathogens, there is a need for proper selection of antibiotics for empirical therapy against UTIs. This study aimed to compare the etiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibility patterns between diabetic and non-diabetic UTI female patients from the Maternity and Children Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Urine samples from different age categories of female UTI patients were collected from January 2021 to June 2023. The positive urine cultures with a single pathogen were selected and all bacterial isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF/MS system. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done using VITEK-2. Our study included 2,245 female patients, of which 1825 (81%) were non-diabetic and 420 (19%) were diabetic. RESULTS: The results showed a significant relationship (p = 0.00063) between the average age and the number of diabetic UTI patients. Gram-negative bacilli were more dominant (84.7%, n = 1903) than gram-positive cocci (15.3%, n = 342). Escherichia coli (40.8%) was the most prevalent pathogen identified with a significant (p < 0.0001) increase in non-diabetic (45.26%) than diabetic UTI patients (21.43%). Proteus mirabilis (10.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.7%) followed E. coli in pathogen distribution. Among gram-positive species, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus were found in all age groups of diabetic and non-diabetic UTI patients. The findings showed that the most resistant bacteria from patients with non-diabetic UTIs were found to be resistant to amoxicillin (37.7%) and ampicillin (40%), while the most resistant bacteria from patients with diabetes were found to be resistant to tetracycline (43.3%) and cephalothin (43.5%). In patients with UTIs, ciprofloxacin was found to be the most effective antibiotic against all bacterial species. DISCUSSION: According to the results, we concluded that the UTI etiological profiles varied among different ages. Ciprofloxacin is a safe medication with optimal sensitivity that can be used to treat both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.","[('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetic', 'DISEASE'), ('UTI', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetic', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetic UTI', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetic UTI', 'DISEASE'), ('Proteus mirabilis', 'DISEASE'), ('Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetic', 'DISEASE'), ('non-diabetic UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diabetes', 'DISEASE'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalothin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

This study investigates the synergistic effects of terpenoids from Cissampelos oppositifolia (C. oppositifolia) essential oil in combination with antibiotics against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The aims were to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy, analyze functional group modifications and assess molecular interaction. METHODS: Essential oil was extracted from C. oppositifolia by hydro-distillation. The EO was analyzed for terpenoid content via Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). Antimicrobial activity was assessed using the disc diffusion method and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration determinations (MIC) by broth dilution followed by bactericidal essay (Time-killing). FTIR and UV spectroscopy were employed to detect functional group modifications in terpenoid-antibiotic combinations. Molecular docking studies assessed interaction energies between terpenoids and antibiotics. RESULTS: TLC identified alpha-pinene, delta-carene, and caryophyllene in the EO. delta-Carene exhibited the highest synergy with antibiotics, showing the lowest MIC of 0.04 mg/mL against S. aureus ATCC-43300 and 0.05 mg/mL against E. coli MTCC-739. Time-kill assays demonstrated that alpha-pinene, delta-carene, and caryophyllene achieved complete bacterial eradication by 4 hours in combination with amoxicillin against E. coli, and by 2 hours against S. aureus in combination with erythromycin. FTIR analysis revealed peak shifts at 1599, 1774, and 2259 cm(-1) for amoxicillin + alpha-pinene, and new peaks at 1648 and 1287 cm(-1) for delta-carene + erythromycin. UV spectra indicated potential complex formations. Docking studies showed delta-carene's strong interaction with erythromycin and amoxicillin, with interaction energies of -96.10 and -87.75 kcal/mol, respectively. CONCLUSION: Terpenoids from C. oppositifolia enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of antibiotics. Functional group modifications and complex formations suggest that these interactions may contribute to synergistic effects. These findings support the potential use of terpenoid-antibiotic combinations in overcoming antibiotic resistance and warrant further investigation into their mechanisms of action.","[('alpha-pinene', 'CHEMICAL'), ('caryophyllene', 'CHEMICAL'), ('S. aureus ATCC-43300 and 0.05 mg/mL', 'DISEASE'), ('alpha-pinene', 'CHEMICAL'), ('caryophyllene', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('S. aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin + alpha-pinene', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

However, medicine quality surveys are often small and unrepresentative of the market, and the true scale of the problem remains unknown. We conducted a large field survey of essential medicines in Indonesia, and investigated how weighting survey results by market volume altered estimates of medicine quality. We collected 1274 samples of allopurinol, amlodipine, cefixime, amoxicillin and dexamethasone from the internet and a randomised sample of all outlet-types where medicines are sold or dispensed in seven districts across the world's fourth most populous nation. We conducted compendial testing for identity, assay, dissolution and uniformity. Samples that failed any chemical test were considered substandard. We compared raw prevalence of substandard medicines with prevalence adjusted by the national sales volume of each brand, relative to its weight among survey samples. The weighted prevalence of substandard products was 4.4%, 47% lower than the raw estimate (8.2%). Only 0.5% of samples (unweighted 1.2%) deviated from permitted limits by more than 10%. More antibiotics failed testing than other medicines (weighted prevalence 8.5 vs 3.1; raw prevalence 13.6 vs 4.9, both p<0.000). We found no relationship between quality and price; branded status; public procurement status; or outlet type. In Indonesia, unweighted survey data appeared to substantially over-estimate the health threat posed by substandard or falsified medicines. The types of sampling bias that led to over-representation of poor quality products in our survey are also indicated in other published surveys, possibly exaggerating the scale of the threat to public health posed by substandard and falsified medicines globally.

The severity of infection by this bacterium is a product of many factors, including virulence properties and antimicrobial resistance. This study aimed to determine the distribution of different virulence genes of E. coli isolates in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients and their association with some selected beta-lactam resistance genes. METHODS: At the Douala Laquintinie Hospital, 518 fecal samples were collected from both hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with enteric infections. E. coli was isolated on eosin-methylene blue agar (EMB) and identified by the Api 20 E Galery. The virulence genes and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) E. coli genes were detected by simplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), while antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the Kirby-Bauer agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The prevalence of enteric infection due to diarrheagenic E. coli (n = 204) was found to be 39.38 % in the general population (n = 518).

The resistance genes bla(TEM) (64.71 % vs 52.38 %) and bla(OXA) (23.53 % vs 9.52 %) were more frequently detected in hypertensive patients than in non-hypertensive patients. The high resistance to AMO was correlated with the presence of the bla(CTX-M) gene (OR: 5.52; 95 % CI: 0.61-49.39; p = 0.093). CONCLUSION: This study reveals the high burden of the typical EPEC, EAEC, and ESBL-P E. coli and confirmed the high occurrence of bla(CTX-M) and bla(TEM) among ESBL-producing E. coli in hypertensive patients. The study suggests that measures need to be taken to reduce the harmfulness of enterovirulent E. coli and the resistance of enterovirulent E. coli in hypertensive patients.","[('acute watery diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('hypertensive', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hypertensive', 'DISEASE'), ('enteric infections', 'DISEASE'), ('enteric infection', 'DISEASE'), ('hypertension', 'DISEASE'), ('HTN', 'DISEASE'), ('hypertensive', 'DISEASE'), ('STEC', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMO', 'DISEASE'), ('SXT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hypertensive', 'DISEASE'), ('hypertensive', 'DISEASE'), ('hypertensive', 'DISEASE'), ('hypertensive', 'DISEASE')]"
39661273,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a major human pathogen whose increased antibiotic resistance poses a serious threat to human health. AIM: The aim of this study is to further explore the association between H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, metronidazole, amoxicillin, rifampicin, tetracycline and its genomic characteristics. METHODOLOGY: Using H. pylori isolates, we studied their susceptibility to six antibiotics by the agar dilution method. By performing whole-genome resequencing of the H. pylori genomic DNA, the differences in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between phenotype resistant and sensitive strains were statistically analyzed to identify potential mutation sites related to drug resistance, and the consistency between genotype and phenotype resistance was analyzed. RESULTS: The drug resistance rates of 65 H. pylori isolates are as follows: clarithromycin 36.9%, levofloxacin 29.2%, metronidazole 63.1%, amoxicillin 7.7%, rifampicin 12.3%, and tetracycline 3.1%. Based on the whole genome resequencing results of H. pylori isolates, 10 new mutations that may be related to drug resistance were identified. There is strong consistency between the genotype and phenotype resistance of clarithromycin and levofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The resistance rate to amoxicillin and tetracycline is relatively low in Northern China. and the above two antibiotics can be given priority for clinical treatment. It has a high resistance rate to metronidazole and should be avoided as much as possible, or combined with other drugs for treatment. The 10 mutations identified through analysis that only exist in drug-resistant strains may be associated with levofloxacin, metronidazole, amoxicillin, and rifampicin resistance, respectively. The results indicate that genotype testing of H. pylori can serve as a method for predicting its resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin.","[('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nucleotide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39659998,2024,"The beta-Lactam antibiotics represent a widely used class of antibiotics, yet the latent and often overlooked risk of coagulation dysfunction associated with their use underscores the need for proactive assessment. Machine learning methodologies can offer valuable insights into evaluating the risk of coagulation dysfunction associated with beta-lactam antibiotics. This study aims to identify the risk factors associated with coagulation dysfunction related to beta-lactam antibiotics and to develop machine learning models for estimating the risk of coagulation dysfunction with real-world data. A retrospective study was performed using machine learning modeling analysis on electronic health record data, employing five distinct machine learning methods. The study focused on adult inpatients discharged from 1 January 2018, to 31 December 2021, at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University. The models were developed for estimating the risk of coagulation dysfunction associated with various beta-lactam antibiotics based on electronic health record feasibility. The dataset was divided into training and test sets to assess model performance using metrics such as total accuracy and area under the curve. The study encompassed risk-factor analysis and machine learning model development for coagulation dysfunction in inpatients administered different beta-lactam antibiotics. A total of 45,179 participants were included in the study. The incidence of coagulation disorders related to cefazolin sodium, cefoperazone/sulbactam sodium, cefminol sodium, amoxicillin/sulbactam sodium, and piperacillin/tazobactam sodium was 2.4%, 5.4%, 1.5%, 5.5%, and 4.8%, respectively. Machine learning models for estimating coagulation dysfunction associated with each beta-lactam antibiotic underwent validation with 5-fold cross-validation and test sets. On the test set, the optimal models for cefazolin sodium, cefoperazone/sulbactam sodium, cefminol sodium, amoxicillin/sulbactam sodium, and piperacillin/tazobactam sodium yielded AUC values of 0.798, 0.768, 0.919, 0.783, and 0.867, respectively. The study findings suggest that machine learning classifiers can serve as valuable tools for identifying patients at risk of coagulation dysfunction associated with beta-lactam antibiotics and intervening based on high-risk predictions.

39659639,2024,"BACKGROUND: Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) is known as a cause of invasive and non-invasive diseases. Especially ear, nose and throat (ENT) infections are common reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in outpatient settings in Germany. Therefore, antibiotic resistance surveillance is important to provide the basis of recommendations for the empirical usage of antibiotic agents. OBJECTIVES: To provide data on susceptibility rates of oral antibiotics for non-invasive clinical Hi isolates in Germany and to investigate molecular resistance patterns of beta-lactams, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. METHODS: Isolates were collected from a sentinel network of diagnostic laboratories in a prospective multicentre prevalence study. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done with a commercial broth microdilution kit. MICs were interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. Resistance gene sequencing and WGS were performed to analyze molecular antibiotic resistance patterns and genetic relationships between the isolates. RESULTS: In total, 215 Hi isolates were collected from 23 laboratories across Germany. The highest resistance rates were found for amoxicillin (n = 30; 14%), cefuroxime (n = 40; 18.6%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) (n = 34; 15.8%). Resistance to amoxicillin was mainly due to bla(TEM-1) (n = 29; 96.7%). PBP3 alterations were found in 39 of 40 cefuroxime-resistant isolates (97.5%). Two of the cefuroxime-resistant isolates harboured PBP3 mutation patterns that have not yet been associated with cefuroxime resistance; in one of them, a known lpoA mutation was found. One isolate showed no mutations in PBP3 or lpoA. All co-trimoxazole-resistant isolates (15.8%) showed known mutations in folA and its promoter region. Additionally, point mutations in folP were identified in a subset of these isolates. The most frequent sequence types (STs) were ST57 (n = 10) and ST103 (n = 10). Genetic cluster analysis identified six clusters, but no epidemiological link could be confirmed. CONCLUSION: Resistance to oral antibiotics in non-invasive clinical Hi isolates in Germany was generally low. Amoxicillin is estimated to cover 86% of infections involving non-invasive Hi and, therefore, is still effective for the first-line empirical treatment for ENT infections in Germany. Further surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility in non-invasive Hi isolates is important to ensure the data basis for guidelines of antibiotic usage.","[('throat', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-trimoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('folA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ST103', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"
39659306,2024,"Pylephlebitis is a rare infection, characterized by non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, that often leads to delayed diagnosis, yet it is a severe infection with a high mortality rate. Imaging studies are essential for diagnosis, and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT and abdominal ultrasound are commonly performed. A 51-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with fever and shock. Blood tests revealed liver and kidney dysfunction. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is the best modality to demonstrate the portal vein abnormalities and diverticulitis. But plain abdominal CT was performed due to renal impairment, revealing findings suggestive of small bowel diverticulitis and paralytic ileus. Septic shock, presumably caused by bacterial translocation secondary to paralytic ileus, was diagnosed, and meropenem was initiated. Subsequent abdominal ultrasound revealed thrombosis in the portal vein and an abscess in the region suspected of being affected by small bowel diverticulitis. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the patient developed pylephlebitis, septic shock, and paralytic ileus as a result of small bowel diverticulitis and the associated abscess formation. Oral amoxicillin/clavulanate was continued until the abscess resolved. Pylephlebitis often progresses to septic shock, as seen in the present case. In severe cases of intra-abdominal infections, such as diverticulitis, it is necessary to consider the possibility of pylephlebitis and actively perform imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis.

Probiotics are effective in patients' antibiotic regimens. This study investigated the efficacy of the Pyloshot probiotic in combination with standard four-drug therapy in patients with H. pylori infection. METHODS: This is an interventional study. The study population consisted of patients with H. pylori infection who were selected using the convenience sampling method and were randomly divided into two groups: (i) A or standard four-drug therapy (amoxicillin-clarithromycin-bismuth-pantoprazole) plus two placebo capsules (80 cases). (ii) B or Pyloshot group (standard four-drug therapy plus 2 Pyloshot probiotic capsules) (90 cases). Patients were followed up for 1 month after treatment completion. Eradication of H. pylori was also assessed using the stool antigen test. Data were analyzed using SPSS (v.26) statistical software. RESULTS: Based on the results from the present study, the number of negative stool antigen tests in group A was less than that in group B, and no statistically significant relationship was found between H. pylori eradication (based on stool antigen test) and the studied groups (P = 0.20). There was a statistically significant relationship between vomiting (P = 0.03), diarrhea (P = 0.04), constipation (P = 0.01), and headache (P = 0.04); vomiting and constipation were most frequent in the control group.

39654641,2024,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Providencia rettgeri, a member of the Morganellaceae family within the Enterobacterales order, is predominantly associated with urinary tract infections in hospitalized individuals, particularly those with indwelling urinary catheters. However, wound infections caused by P. rettgeri are exceedingly rare, with an estimated incidence of around 0.1 %. Here, we present a case of wound infection in a healthy child caused by P. rettgeri, highlighting the rarity of the organism and emphasizing the importance of prompte identification and appropriate antibiotic therapy. CASE REPORT: A 4-year-old child presented with a soft tissue abscess in the left calf, following an injury sustained from a tree trunk a few days prior. The patient underwent wound debridement and abscess drainage, followed by empirical antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Bacteriological samples collected intraoperatively revealed colonies of P. rettgeri, identified with high certainty using the BD Phoenix 100 automated system. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed resistance to several antibiotics but sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporins, amikacin, and aztreonam. Antibiotic therapy was adjusted accordingly, leading to clinical improvement and discharge after ten days of hospitalization. DISCUSSION: P. rettgeri, a Gram-negative bacillus, is a rare causative agent of wound infections. While predominantly associated with nosocomial urinary tract infections, it can rarely lead to various other infections, including wound infections, particularly in hospitalized or immunocompromised individuals. Resistance to multiple antibiotics, including carbapenems, poses challenges in treatment selection. CONCLUSION: This case underscores the importance of considering P. rettgeri as a potential pathogen in wound infections, even in healthy individuals. Awareness of its presence and antibiotic susceptibility patterns is crucial for appropriate management and prevention of complications. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the epidemiology and clinical significance of P. rettgeri infections in different patient populations.","[('Providencia rettgeri', 'DISEASE'), ('urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('P. rettgeri', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('P. rettgeri', 'DISEASE'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amikacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('nosocomial urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('rettgeri', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('P. rettgeri infections', 'DISEASE')]"

Due to the increased use of antibiotics, especially amoxicillin, which is commonly used in clinical practice, the incidence of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis has also increased. However, doctors have insufficient understanding of this disease, and patients may be missed or misdiagnosed. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 71-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stools. There was a history of oral amoxicillin before the onset of the disease. DIAGNOSIS: The final diagnosis of this patient was amoxicillin-associated hemorrhagic colitis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient stopped using antibiotics and was given ""Bifidobacterium quadruplex live bacterial tablets and L-glutamine sodium gualenate granules"" orally. OUTCOMES: After oral administration, the patient's symptom rapidly were completely alleviate. Follow-up colonoscopy revealed normal mucosal images. LESSON: Through this case report, doctors should increase their understanding of the disease, especially for patients with sudden abdominal pain accompanied by bloody stools as the main complaint, it is significant to attend to inquiries about the history of antibiotic use, such as amoxicillin, and pay attention to the discovery of acid-producing Klebsiella in the fecal microbiota.","[('hemorrhagic colitis', 'DISEASE'), ('colitis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hemorrhagic colitis', 'DISEASE'), ('abdominal pain', 'DISEASE'), ('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hemorrhagic colitis', 'DISEASE'), ('L-glutamine sodium gualenate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('abdominal pain', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39649642,2024,"BACKGROUND: Mendelian randomization (MR) has been used to identify drug targets in many conditions. Height is a classic complex trait affected by genetic and early-life environmental factors. No systematic screening has been conducted to identify drugs that interact with height. We investigated the causal relationship between genes and height, and systematically screened for interactive drugs that may promote or delay growth. METHODS: We performed MR using summary statistics from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits consortium (N=253,288), the UK Biobank (N=461,950), and the BioBank Japan Project (N=159,095). Gene expression-single-nucleotide polymorphism associations represented by cis-expression quantitative trait loci data were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression study and were used as genetic instruments. We performed annotation and enrichment analyses of the genes. Interactive drugs were identified through drug-gene interactions. RESULTS: Of the 27,094 genes screened, 209 had causal associations with height, including genes associated with height and short stature phenotypes (AMZ1, GNA12, NPPC, UQCC1, and ZBTB38), genes associated with height in a few studies (ANKIB1, CEP250, DCAF16, HIST1H4E, and HLA-C), and genes without previous evidence (BTN2A2 and RBMS1P1). Enrichment analysis showed that transcriptional regulation by RUNX1 was the most enriched pathway. Interactive drugs were identified, including amoxicillin, atenolol, infliximab, colchicine, propionyl-L-carnitine, BMN-111, and tamoxifen, which were known to have a positive effect on height. We also identified drugs that had a negative effect on height, including antineoplastic drugs, corticosteroids, and antiepileptic drugs. Moreover, many interactive drugs have not been previously reported to be associated with height. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that many genes have causal effects on height. By interrogating drug-gene interactions, interactive drugs have been identified as having both positive and negative effects on growth, which would help make clinical decisions.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('atenolol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colchicine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('propionyl-L-carnitine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tamoxifen', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39644828,2025,"Streptococcus suis is an important pig pathogen that can cause severe disease in the post-weaning period. As there are no commercial vaccines available in the Netherlands, antibiotic treatment is often necessary to control disease. S. suis is regarded as one of the major causes of antibiotic prescription in weaned pigs, but scientific studies supporting this claim with quantitative data are lacking. The aim of this study was to obtain insight in, and to quantify usage of, antibiotics against S. suis in weaner pigs at sow farms in the Netherlands. Three sources of data were used, including 1) total antibiotic usage in weaner pigs in the Netherlands, as yearly reported by the Netherlands Veterinary Medicines Institute (SDa), and estimates from 2) pig veterinarians and 3) pig farmers on the relative amount of antibiotics prescribed against S. suis, via questionnaires. Information from the SDa on the total amount of antibiotic usage was combined with the estimates of the veterinarians to estimate the antibiotic usage against S. suis in weaner pigs. Our study shows that  approximately 90 % of the total amount of amoxicillin (AMOX) and ampicillin (AMPI) prescribed in weaner pigs is used for treatment of disease caused by S. suis (S. suis disease). Of all orally prescribed antibiotics against S. suis, AMOX comprises 85 % of the total absolute usage expressed by the mean defined daily dosage per animal farm (3.2 - 5.4 mean DDDA(F)). Furthermore, veterinarians reported that at farms with structural S. suis disease problems second choice antibiotics (AMOX, AMPI) are more often prescribed than at farms with incidental S. suis disease. All together, we estimated that S. suis disease accounts for about 1/3rd of the total antibiotic usage in weaner pigs. This study is the first to quantify antibiotic usage against S. suis in weaner pigs and shows that S. suis is a hotspot of antibiotic usage.

Study tools included record review, quantitative, in-depth, and key informant interviews. Quantitative data were analysed using STATA version 15 (STATACorp Inc., TX, USA), whereas qualitative data were analysed using a framework analysis approach. Our assessment showed that 2,228 young infants (0-59 days old) from the three districts were classified as having PSBI.

We computed simple proportions and conducted a hypotheses test using Chi-Square to test for Significance. RESULTS: Antibiotic dispensing practices were surveyed in 51 retail drug outlets comprising 36 retail pharmacies and 15 drugstores. 35.3% (n=18) of the drug outlets had drug dispensing done by pharmacists, 13.7% (n=7) by pharmacy technicians, 21.5% (n=11) by pharmacy assistants and 25.5% (n=15) by drug dispensers who had no pharmacy-related training. The rate of non-prescription sales of antibiotics ranged between 53% for acute diarrhoea and 92% for upper respiratory tract infections. Amoxicillin was the most dispensed antibiotic across all case scenarios. Over 50% of dispensed antibiotics were done upon recommendation of the drug dispensers in the absence of a doctor's prescription. Furthermore, for all the dispensed antibiotics across all case scenarios, no advice was given for finishing a full course of the antibiotics. CONCLUSION: This study found high rates of over-the-counter dispensing of antibiotics, which call for urgent and comprehensive regulatory measures to control antibiotic consumption in an urban part of Malawi that risks increased AMR. These could range from enacting stringent antibiotic dispensing policies to deploying digital systems to monitor prescription practices and community education on rational antibiotic use.","[('diarrhoea', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

In this clinical syndrome, mild hepatitis with a slight elevation of aminotransferases is common. However, cholestasis is rare and usually occurs alongside a more severe, cytolytic hepatitis. This case report describes a 26-year-old male admitted to the emergency service with recurrent fever, odynophagia, and painful cervical lymphadenopathy, along with a skin rash after starting treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate, and jaundice. The analytical assessment was consistent with cholestatic hepatitis, and the abdominal CT scan revealed hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis of EBV infection was confirmed by the presence of serological markers. This case aims to raise awareness of a rare manifestation of a common infectious agent in order to consider acute EBV infection in the differential diagnosis of cholestatic hepatitis in adult patients.","[('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('infectious mononucleosis', 'DISEASE'), ('hepatitis', 'DISEASE'), ('cholestasis', 'DISEASE'), ('hepatitis', 'DISEASE'), ('fever', 'DISEASE'), ('odynophagia', 'DISEASE'), ('painful cervical lymphadenopathy', 'DISEASE'), ('skin rash', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('jaundice', 'DISEASE'), ('cholestatic hepatitis', 'DISEASE'), ('hepatosplenomegaly', 'DISEASE'), ('EBV infection', 'DISEASE'), ('acute EBV infection', 'DISEASE'), ('cholestatic hepatitis', 'DISEASE')]"

This study determined the correlation between specific phenotypic and genotypic metrics and the NaHCO(3)-responsive phenotype among U.S. SSTI isolates. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed to determine susceptibility phenotypes. Targeted and whole-genome sequencing with a genome-wide sequence analysis were conducted to identify specific and novel genotypes of interest that may be associated with the NaHCO(3)-responsive phenotype. Gene expression analysis and targeted gene deletion were performed to assess the role of a specific novel genetic locus in the NaHCO(3)-responsive phenotype. RESULTS: The NaHCO(3)-responsive phenotype was identified in 78/103 U.S. isolates and 4/22 UK isolates to cefazolin (CFZ), and in 17/103 U.S. isolates and 1/22 UK isolates to oxacillin. In U.S. isolates, a significant association was identified between NaHCO(3)-responsiveness to CFZ and: (a) susceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanate; (b) a specific mecA genotype; (c) clonal complex type 8; and (d) spa type t008. Genome-wide sequence analysis identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an AraC family regulator (SAUSA300_RS00540) to be exclusively found in NaHCO(3)-non-responsive SSTI strains. In vitro HCO(3) exposures of NaHCO(3)-responsive strains, but not -non-responsive strains, caused >2-fold upregulated expression of this gene. Deletion of this gene rendered NaHCO(3)-responsive strain MRSA 11/11 no longer NaHCO(3)-responsive to CFZ; we have termed this gene the staphylococcal AraC bicarbonate-response regulator. DISCUSSION: NaHCO(3)-responsiveness is highly associated with clonal complex type 8/spa type t008, a commonly circulating genetic background in North America. The AraC bicarbonate-response regulator, staphylococcal AraC bicarbonate-response regulator, appears to be associated with the mechanism of NaHCO(3)-responsiveness, but more work is needed to verify.","[('sodium bicarbonate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('soft-tissue infection', 'DISEASE'), ('SSTI', 'DISEASE'), ('SSTI', 'DISEASE'), ('SSTI', 'DISEASE'), ('cefazolin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CFZ', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NaHCO(3)-responsiveness', 'DISEASE'), ('CFZ', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nucleotide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AraC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('SSTI', 'DISEASE'), ('CFZ', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AraC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AraC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AraC', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39626833,2025,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of two macroscopic quality indicators to guide antibiotic stewardship strategies. METHODS: Setting: Bourgogne-Franche-Comte region (eight departments). Antibiotic reimbursement data, expressed in defined daily doses, were used to calculate two macroscopic quality indicators from 2015 to 2020. Urinary tract infection indicator: (fosfomycin + nitrofurantoin + pivmecillinam) / (ciprofloxacin + ofloxacin + norfloxacin) calculated in women aged 15 to 64. Indicator for ear, nose, throat and respiratory tract infections: (amoxicillin/ (amoxicillin-clavulanate + oral 3GC) calculated in children under 15 years of age. RESULTS: In 2020, global antibiotic consumption varied from 22.2 to 26.6 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, depending on the department. The macroscopic quality indicators were lowest in the departments of Nievre and Yonne. The scores for the urinary tract infection indicator were 0.55 and 0.74, respectively, while those for the ear, nose and throat and respiratory tract infection indicators were 1.85 and 2.12, respectively. Both scores continuously increased in all departments of the region during the survey, except in 2020 for the urinary tract infection indicator, due to a nitrofurantoin shortage. CONCLUSION: Even in departments with low antibiotic consumption, our macroscopic quality indicators help to identify antibiotic stewardship targets for the most common community-based infections,. They are easy to calculate from quantitative data without requiring any information on diagnosis. Complementarily to other indicators, they provide messages specifically addressed to general practitioners regarding population, molecules and diagnostic elements.","[('Urinary tract infection', 'DISEASE'), ('fosfomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pivmecillinam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('norfloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('throat', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin/', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('urinary tract infection', 'DISEASE'), ('throat', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('urinary tract infection', 'DISEASE'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"

High-dose amoxicillin approaches adult doses which makes clinicians reluctant to exceed ""adult doses."" This study examines the disparity of amoxicillin dosing between the ages of children. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 5503 children prescribed amoxicillin regardless of diagnosis. The final cohort consisted of 3620 encounters with infections that align with recommendations of high-dose amoxicillin. RESULTS: Linear regression demonstrated a significant negative correlation between age/dose (mg/kg/d) and weight/dose (mg/kg/d). Larger children are prescribed declining doses in mg/kg/d, so most patients above 60 kg are dosed at less than 40 mg/kg/d. Children 6 years and under cluster around the 80 mg/kg/d dose. CONCLUSIONS: Older children receiving a lower than recommended dose per kilogram of amoxicillin for conditions that require high-dose amoxicillin.

However, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria poses significant challenges to antibiotic therapy. Although fosfomycin has been demonstrated to achieve and maintain high concentrations in urine, suggesting its potential for treating UTIs in dogs, its efficacy and the resistance profiles of urinary pathogens from canine UTIs remain elusive. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from companion dogs with UTIs, with a particular focus on their susceptibility and resistance to fosfomycin. A total of 70 isolates from urine samples were analyzed, of which Escherichia coli (n = 18), Proteus mirabilis (n = 9), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 5), and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (n = 5) were predominant. Resistance to erythromycin was most prevalent (94.59%), followed by clindamycin (91.89%) and ampicillin (78.37%), whereas the lowest resistance rate was observed for amikacin (5.40%). Resistance to fosfomycin was observed in 15 out of the 37 predominant isolates (40.54%), including all K. pneumoniae isolates (100%). All isolates, except 4 E. coli strains, were categorized as MDR (33 out of 37; 89.18%). The resistance rates for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which are common first-line antibiotics for canine UTIs, were 48.64 and 56.75%, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing of K. pneumoniae isolates, which exhibited high resistance to fosfomycin, revealed multiple antibiotic resistance genes, with chromosomal fosA present in all isolates. Among the 27 dogs with recurrent infection included in this study, 2 were administered fosfomycin, resulting in clinical remission, as evidenced by negative urine culture tests.

In the last three years, in the period of intense population aging, migrations and climate changes in Europe and Croatia as well, we observed changes in antibiotic resistance patters of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates obtained routinely in community and inpatient setting. The aim was to compare and subsequently analyze CRKP hospital and community isolates resistance mechanisms, traits and molecular epidemiology, in order to analyze the dynamic of resistance trends, carbapenemase types and plasmid epidemiology. Disk diffusion and broth dilution method were the methods of choice to determine antibiotic susceptibility. beta-lactamases were screened by phenotypic methods and confirmed with PCR. In total 113 isolates were analysed. Resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ertapenem was confirmed in all strains. High resistance rates (over 90%) were observed for extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and ciprofloxacin. OKNV (OXA-48, KPC, NDM, VIM) testing and PCR detected OXA-48 in 106, NDM in 7 and KPC in only one isolate. ESBLs accompanied carbapenemases in 103 isolates. IncL, associated with OXA-48, was the dominant plasmid type. No significant differences in the resistance profile and resistance determinants were found between hospital and community isolates plasmid type. The predominance of OXA-48 carbapenemase is in line with the reports from the neigbouring countries.","[('pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ertapenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NDM', 'DISEASE'), ('NDM', 'DISEASE'), ('ESBLs', 'DISEASE')]"
39596929,2024,"Background and Objectives: The inappropriate use of antibiotics can lead to antimicrobial resistance. Overprescribing in dental practice has been reported. This study aimed to describe patterns of antibiotic prescription for treating and preventing odontogenic infections based on reports from Lithuanian dentists. Materials and Methods: Questionnaires were sent to all 4751 Lithuanian dentists registered in the database of the Lithuanian Dental Chamber who had consented to participate in surveys. The questionnaire addressed antibiotic prescription preferences for the treatment and prevention of various dental pathologies. The statistical analysis included chi-square tests and a factor analysis to evaluate prescription frequences in different clinical scenarios considering the respondents' specialty and age. Results: Of 647 responses, 497 were from general dentists, 35 from oral surgeons, 40 from endodontists, 20 from periodontists, and 35 from prosthodontists. Respondents were grouped by age: A (</=35 years, n = 207), B (36-50 years, n = 224), and C (>/=51 years, n = 209). Amoxicillin was the first-choice antibiotic for 81.1% of respondents (group A more frequently than other groups, p = 0.001). A 7-day treatment duration was preferred by 60.8%, while 33.6% chose 5 days. For patients allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics, 63% preferred clindamycin. Over 90% cited acute apical abscess with systematic involvement as an indication for antibiotic prescription. A factor analysis of 18 clinical scenarios revealed prescription differences among dental specialists, oral surgeons, and periodontists prescribing antibiotics more frequently than general dentists and endodontists. For prophylaxis, 87.5% recommended antibiotics for patients at risk of infectious endocarditis after a cardiologist's consultation (group C less frequently than other groups, p = 0.021). Conclusions: Lithuanian dentists generally prefer narrow-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of odontogenic infections. There are notable differences in prescription patterns among dental specialists, with younger dentists showing a trend towards more rational antibiotic use.","[('odontogenic infections', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('allergic', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('abscess', 'DISEASE'), ('infectious endocarditis', 'DISEASE'), ('odontogenic infections', 'DISEASE')]"
39596766,2024,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global health challenge affecting food safety and development. Residues of antibiotics in food from animal sources, particularly milk, contribute to the development and spread of AMR, alter intestinal microbiota, and potentially lead to allergies, serious health conditions, and environmental and technological problems within the dairy industry. Therefore, this study investigated the residue levels of veterinary drugs from beta-lactam antibiotics and tetracyclines in milk and milk products and assessed human health risks. Two hundred milk and milk product samples (pasteurized milk, sterile milk, soft white cheese, and processed cheese, 50 each) were collected from different hospitals in the State of Kuwait and screened for antibiotic residues using a microbial inhibition assay (Delvotest SP-NT) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Delvotest SP-NT and HPLC analyses showed that 30, 28, 26, and 24% of the pasteurized milk, sterilized milk, white soft cheese, and processed cheese samples tested positive for antibiotic residues. Forty-eight milk and cheese samples were confirmed as positive by both methods, and six samples initially found to be negative by Delvotest SP-NT were confirmed as positive by HPLC. Multi-antibiotic residues were detected in five samples by using HPLC. The kappa coefficient (0.921; p < 0.0001) revealed complete concordance between the HPLC and Delvotest SP-NT results. Ampicillin was the most abundant residue in the positive samples (31.48%), ranging from 2.44 to 3.89 mug/L, with an overall mean concentration of 3.492 +/- 0.094 mug/L, followed by tetracycline and oxytetracycline (27.78% each), ranging from 54.13 to 220.3 mug/L and from 41.55 to 160.7 mug/L, with mean concentrations of 129.477 +/- 14.22 and 91.86 +/- 9.92 mug/L, respectively. The amoxicillin levels in the samples (12/54; 22.22%) ranged from 3.11 to 5.5 mug/L, with an overall mean concentration of 3.685 +/- 0.186 mug/L. The maximum concentrations of ampicillin, amoxicillin, and tetracycline were detected in processed cheese with mean concentrations of 3.89 +/- 0.28 microg/L, 3.95 +/- 0.15 microg/L, and 170.3 +/- 0.27 microg/L, respectively. Pasteurized milk contained the maximum concentrations of oxytetracycline, with a mean concentration of 120.45 +/- 0.25 microg/L. The tetracycline residues exceeded the standard maximum residue limits (MRLs; 100 microg/L) in 6% of both pasteurized and sterilized milk samples, and in 4% of processed cheese. Additionally, the oxytetracycline levels in pasteurized milk (6%) and amoxicillin levels in processed cheese (2%) were higher than the permitted MRLs (100 microg/L and 4 microg/L, respectively). Furthermore, the antibiotic residues detected in 12.5% (25/200) of the samples were close to standard permissible MRL limits for ampicillin (5%), amoxicillin and oxytetracycline (3% each), and tetracycline (1.5%). Hazard quotients, which compare the standard acceptable daily intake (ADI) to the estimated daily exposure (EDI), indicated that the overall risk associated with antibiotic residues in these dairy products is low. The EDI was lower than the ADI for the tested antibiotics, indicating an elevated safety margin. While the overall hazard quotients are low, the potential for the development of antibiotic resistance due to long-term exposure to low levels of antibiotics should be considered. Hence, strict regulations and enforcement are necessary to prevent excessive residue levels and to promote responsible antibiotic use in dairy production. Regular monitoring of antibiotic residues in dairy products is essential for ensuring consumer safety.","[('allergies', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracyclines', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oxytetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oxytetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oxytetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oxytetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39596699,2024,"Background/objectives: Bismuth is commonly used in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy. However, few studies have examined the in vitro susceptibility of H. pylori to bismuth. Moreover, the exact mechanism of action of bismuth on H. pylori remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the anti-bacterial effect of bismuth as well as to evaluate potential synergistic effects between bismuth and various antibiotics. Methods: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of three bismuth preparations, bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth potassium citrate, and colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS, De-Nol) were determined for H. pylori strains using the agar dilution technique. Agar plates of varying pH values from 5.0 to 8.0 were used to investigate whether acidity influences the anti-bacterial effect of bismuth. A checkerboard assay was performed to assess the synergism between CBS and antibiotics (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole). Results: Twelve H. pylori strains, including three reference strains (H. pylori 26695, J99, and ATCC 43504), and nine clinically isolated strains were tested. The MICs for bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth potassium citrate, and CBS ranged from 4 to 32 mug/mL, 2 to 16 mug/mL, and 1 to 8 mug/mL, respectively. The bismuth MICs for the reference strains were similar at pH 5-8. In the checkerboard assay, no interactions between CBS and any of the antibiotics were observed in the reference H. pylori strains. Conclusions: Bismuth showed in vitro susceptibility against H. pylori. The enhanced eradication efficacy of bismuth-containing regimens appears to be due to mechanisms other than direct synergy with antibiotics.","[('Bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth subsalicylate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth potassium citrate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colloidal bismuth subcitrate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CBS,', 'CHEMICAL'), ('De-Nol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth subsalicylate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth potassium citrate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Bismuth', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Thus, we aimed to determine the effect of VA-dual plus Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) on H. pylori eradication rate. METHODS: Naive H. pylori-infected patients were randomly allocated to the ECAB group [20-mg esomeprazole, 500-mg clarithromycin, 1000-mg amoxicillin, and 220-mg bismuth twice/day for 14 days] or the VAS group [20-mg VPZ twice/day, 750-mg amoxicillin three times/day, and 250-mg S. boulardii twice/day for 10 days]. Factors associated with eradication success were explored, and cost-effectiveness analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Herein, 126 patients were finally included and randomly assigned to the two groups in a 1:1 ratio. The H. pylori eradication rates of VAS and ECAB groups by intention-to-treat analysis were 87.3% and 88.9% (P = 1.000) and by per-protocol analysis were 87.3% and 91.8% (P = 0.560), respectively. The ECAB group had a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than the VAS group. Superior H. pylori eradication in the VAS group was related to small body surface area and being a non-smoker. The cost-effectiveness ratio of the VAS group was less than that of the ECAB group. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of S. boulardii to VA-dual for 10 days is as effective as the 14-days bismuth-based quadruple regimen while ensuring fewer adverse events and lesser cost. This regimen is particularly suitable for low-BSA patients or non-smokers.

39591336,2024,"This study investigated the bacteriological quality of raw ovine milk produced by farms located in the Banat region of Romania. Additionally, the pathogenic potential and antimicrobial resistance of the isolated Escherichia coli strains were evaluated. A total of 95.8% (69/72) of the screened bulk tank milk samples, collected at the farm level immediately after milking, demonstrated appropriate total aerobic mesophilic bacteria (TMB) counts, varying from 3.32 to 6.09 log10 CFU/mL. However, 4.2% (3/72) of the samples were above the regulatory limit of 6.18 log10 CFU/mL. E. coli was identified in 66.6% of the examined samples, and from the total number (n = 48) of isolates, 18.8% harbored the stx2 gene, highlighting pathogenic potential.

39588105,2024,"BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are an increasing problem for patients today. Data on clinical samples for ESBL and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae for surgical site infection patients in developing countries are limited, including Ethiopia, mainly due to resource constraints. Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae among patients suspected to have surgical site infection at Hospital in Southern Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 422 suspected surgical site infections from June 1, 2022 to August 30, 2022 at Hospitals in Southern Ethiopia. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained by using a structured questionnaire. Clinical samples (pus, pus aspirates, and wound swabs) were collected aseptically and processed within 30 min by placing the swabs in sterile test tubes containing sterile normal saline (0.5 mL). Samples were cultured on blood and MacConkey agar plates. All positive cultures were characterized by colony morphology, Gram staining, and standard biochemical tests. Antimicrobial sensitivity tests were performed using Kirby Baur disk diffusion on Mueller-Hinton agar. ESBL production was confirmed using a double-disc synergy test (DDST) method. Carbapenemase production was assessed using the modified Hodge test. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine associated factors. A P-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULT: Bacteria belonging to the order Enterobacterales were cultured in 23.7% out of 422 patients with suspected surgical wound infection. Of all the isolates, Enterobacteriaceae (69 isolates) were the most frequent, with E. coli (29/69) followed by K. pneumoniae (14/69). Of 69 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 66.6 % (46/69) were positive for ESBL production, and 21.7 (15/69) were positive for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae isolates showed sensitivity to meropenem (72.1%); however revealed 63.9% and 70.5% were resistant to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Similarly, a higher resistance rate to cefepime (91.8%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (98.4%), ceftriaxone (95.1%), and ceftazidime (91.8%). MDR rate of Enterobacteriaceae isolates was 25/61 (41%) among patients suspected for surgical site infection. The Multivariable analysis revealed that length of hospital stay in hospital [AOR = 3.81 (95% CI 2.08-6.95)] remained statistically significant factor associated with surgical site infection due to ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSION: Study results showed the severity of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is critical and CPE is alarming. Meropenem is the most effective antibiotic against the ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. MDR rate of Enterobacteriaceae isolates was 61 (61%) among patients suspected for surgical site infection.

Using Lipinski's Rule of Five (Ghose filter, Veber rules, Muegge filter, and Egan's rule), 4d and 4e were determined to be the most promising candidates for drug development due to their compliance with all evaluated criteria, indicating favourable properties for oral bioavailability and drug likeness.

39582213,2024,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Only a few studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of different durations of vonoprazan and amoxicillin (VA) high-dose dual therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of 10 days versus 14 days of VA high-dose dual therapy for H. pylori eradication. METHODS: This study was conducted in 14 centers in China. A total of 250 patients infected with H. pylori were randomly assigned to Group VA-10 or VA-14. Both groups received the VA dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily + amoxicillin 1000 mg three times daily). The primary endpoint was the H. pylori eradication rate. Secondary endpoints included adverse events and patient compliance. RESULTS: Group VA-10 achieved eradication rates of 89.60%, 91.06%, and 91.67% as determined by the intention-to-treat (ITT), modified intention-to-treat (MITT), and per-protocol (PP) analysis, respectively. The eradication rates were similar to those in Group VA-14: 91.20%, 93.44%, and 93.39%. The difference and 90% confidence interval boundary -1.60% (-7.73% to 4.53%) in the ITT analysis, -2.39% (-8.00% to 3.23%) in the MITT analysis, and -1.72% (-7.29% to 3.85%) in the PP analysis were greater than the predefined noninferiority margin of -10%, establishing a noninferiority of Group VA-10 versus Group VA-14 (noninferiority P = 0.001 in ITT analysis, P < 0.001 in MITT analysis, and P < 0.001 in PP analysis, respectively). No significant differences were observed in adverse events between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ten-day VA dual therapy achieves comparable efficacy and safety to the 14-day regimen in Chinese population, providing patients with greater convenience and economic benefits.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('high-dose', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39581435,2024,"OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is considered a potential treatment for biofilm infections, which have become an increasing health issue because of the rise in antimicrobial resistance. This study aimed to evaluate the bactericidal effect of aPDT using indocyanine green-loaded nanospheres with chitosan coating (ICG-Nano/c) against polymicrobial periodontal biofilms. METHODS: Composite biofilms of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii were constructed in 96-well plates, and aPDT with ICG-Nano/c and an 810 nm diode laser was performed either by direct irradiation or transmitting irradiation through a 3-mm-thick gingival model. The efficacy of ICG-Nano/c-based aPDT was compared with antibiotics (minocycline and amoxicillin). Additionally, attenuated aPDT under sublethal conditions was used to investigate gene expression related to the antioxidant response (oxyR and sod of P. gingivalis) and biofilm formation via quorum sensing (luxS of both species) with real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: ICG-Nano/c-based aPDT significantly reduced the bacterial load in the biofilm, achieving at least a 2 log(10) reduction in colony-forming units within 5 min for both irradiation methods. After 6 h of treatment, the bactericidal effects of aPDT and antibiotics were similar, but after 32 h, antibiotics were more effective, particularly against P. gingivalis. Attenuated aPDT showed a slight increase in sod expression in P. gingivalis, while luxS expression decreased in both bacteria. CONCLUSION: The ICG-Nano/c-based aPDT system exerted a certain degree of bactericidal activity against a composite biofilm of periodontal bacteria. Therefore, it has potential as an alternative option or adjunctive therapy to conventional antibiotics in periodontal treatment.","[('biofilm infections', 'DISEASE'), ('indocyanine green-loaded', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chitosan', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polymicrobial', 'DISEASE'), ('Porphyromonas gingivalis', 'DISEASE'), ('minocycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sublethal', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39579944,2025,"Bacterial co-infection with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) can effect on the clinical appearance of lesions and delay the healing process. The pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated in Iraq. The aim of present study was to identify the bacterial agents contaminating CL and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. Four hundred cases of CL were diagnosed in Salah El-Din General Hospital, Iraq. A total of 424 ulcer samples obtained from 400 patients of CL were cultured, and all isolates were diagnosed based on phenotypic characteristics of colonies, bacterial cells and using biochemical tests. No bacterial growth appeared in 124 cases (29.25 %) of the total number of examined ulcer samples, whereas 300 cases (70.75 %) were contaminated. Both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative bacterial species (Escherichi coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were present. The infection with S. aureus represented the highest percentage (26.42 %), while Ps. aeruginosa had the lowest percentage (2.83 %) compared with other bacterial infections. The sensitivity of the isolated bacteria associated with CL was tested against a number of antibiotics (Amoxicillin, Ampicillin, Cefixime, Chloramphenlcol, Doxycycline, Tetracycline). Resistance to Amoxicillin, Ampicillin, and Cefixime was generally high. While, Chloramphenicol showed absolute effectiveness against isolated bacteria. The results of the current study show that bacterial infections should be considered in diagnosing and treating CL lesions, with Chloramphenicol demonstrating the highest efficiency in treating such bacterial infections. The present study also suggests that hygiene, use of suitable disinfectants, controlling of antibiotic administration and prescription in hospitals and pharmacies must be ensured. In addition, regular surveillance in the endemic area will help control bacterial co-infection and hamper the occurrence of drug-resistant pathogens. The lesion care and management of secondary bacterial infection are essential and anti -leishmanial therapy in CL may be more effective when combined with antibiotics. Future molecular studies are needed to identify the species of Leishmania causing CL in Iraq to gain a better understanding of their clinical manifestations (dry or moist ulcers) and their associated bacteria.","[('cutaneous leishmaniasis', 'DISEASE'), ('ulcer', 'DISEASE'), ('ulcer', 'DISEASE'), ('Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('S. aureus', 'DISEASE'), ('aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Cefixime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Cefixime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Chloramphenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE'), ('Chloramphenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial infection', 'DISEASE'), ('Leishmania', 'DISEASE')]"
39579477,2025,"OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial stewardship is critical for the prevention of antimicrobial resistance. A lack of prescribing guidelines makes overprescribing in veterinary dentistry likely and represents an opportunity for improvement of stewardship practices. This study described prescribing practices of residency-trained and board-certified veterinary dentists for dogs and cats undergoing dental procedures. METHODS: Antibiotic-use data were collected from the first 10 patients presenting for a dental procedure at each of 22 participating clinics beginning on October 2, 2023. RESULTS: 35% of patients undergoing procedures received 1 or more systemically administered antibiotic, most commonly amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin-sulbactam, and clindamycin. Half (43 of 85 [50.6%]) of prescriptions for dogs were for perioperative or postoperative prophylaxis. For dogs, antibiotic duration for prophylactic versus treatment purposes was not significantly different. Common conditions included periodontal disease, tooth fractures, and oral masses. Comorbid conditions were present in 22.3% (49 of 220) of patients. Presence of comorbid conditions was not a risk factor for antibiotic prescribing. Tooth extractions were a risk factor for antibiotic prescribing among patients with periodontal disease, and those with >/= 11 were more likely to receive antibiotics than those with < 5 extractions. CONCLUSIONS: This study characterized antibiotic use among canine and feline dental procedures performed by residency-trained and board-certified veterinary dentists and identified tooth extractions as a risk factor for antibiotic prescribing.

However, data related to the carriage of these bacteria in children attending outpatient departments in the study area are limited. To assess nasopharyngeal carriage, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, and associated factors of gram-negative bacteria among children attending the outpatient department at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1, 2023, to December 30, 2023. A total of 385 children aged 3 to 14 years were enrolled using a systematic random sampling technique. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using a semistructured questionnaire. A total of 385 nasopharyngeal samples were collected using a sterile specimen collection nasopharyngeal swab, transported using Amie's transport medium, and subsequently inoculated on chocolate agar, blood agar, modified thayer martin agar, and MacConkey agar plates. Bacterial species were identified by colony morphology, Gram staining, and biochemical tests such as oxidase tests, satellitism tests, and carbohydrate utilization tests. An antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using the Kirby-Bauer and modified Kirby-Bauer methods on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. The data were entered into Epi-Data version 4.6.0.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. The adjusted odds ratio at a 95% confidence interval with a P value of < 0.05 in the binary logistic regression model was considered to indicate statistical significance. The overall nasopharyngeal carriage of gram-negative bacteria was 146 (37.9%) (95% CI: 33.2-42.9). Among these, nonfastidious gram-negative bacteria represented 45 (11.7%), followed by M. catarrhalis 41 (10.6%), N. meningitidis 34 (8.8%), and H. influenzae 26 (6.8%).

METHODS: Pediatric participants with PCD were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter, observational study. Therapies were recorded at annual visits and categorized by type. Age-related trends in prevalence of therapies were described by serial cross-sectional analyses. Generalized estimating equations analyzed covariates affecting prevalence of certain therapies and whether these covariates impacted oral antibiotic courses. RESULTS: A total of 137 participants completed 897 visits over 13 years. All but one received >/= 1 antibiotic courses during study participation, most often cephalosporins (74%) or amoxicillin-clavulanate (73%). Thirty-one percent reported chronic azithromycin use. Per participant, there was an average of 2.3 (SD = 2.2) oral antibiotic courses annually. The rate of reported antibiotic courses at the 6 United States sites was 2.6 times higher compared to the Canadian site (p < 0.001). As patients got older, they were more likely to report use of amoxicillin-clavulanate (p < 0.001), chronic azithromycin (p < 0.001), fluroquinolones (p < 0.001), inhaled steroids with long-acting beta-agonists (p = 0.010), and hypertonic saline (p < 0.001). Compared to outer dynein arm defects, those with inner dynein arm/microtubular disorganization defects reported increased use of chronic azithromycin (p = 0.011) and inhaled steroids (p = 0.015).

Based on suspicion of bacterial tonsillitis, the patient was already taking amoxicillin with clavulanate. A rapid test was negative for group A streptococci. Laboratory exams revealed elevated counts of Anti-VCA IgM and Anti-VCA IgG for EBV. The cytomegalovirus (IgM and IgG) result was negative, and the blood count was within normal limits. However, a COVID-19 infection was confirmed by qPCR. The management was supportive treatment for symptom relief and isolation for 14 days. The patient remained afebrile and clinically stable during this period, with saturation ranging from 98% to 100%. However, the patient evolved with anosmia and ageusia. Then, olfaction training therapy was initiated, as well as continuing asthenia. Five days later, she presented petechiae on the chest and upper limbs, associated with mild pruritus.

The aim of the study was to evaluate drug usage patterns in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) outpatient settings by incorporating established benchmarks and World Health Organization (WHO) indicators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study on drug utilization evaluation (DUE) was conducted on 800 patients from the ENT outpatient department. We gathered data on currently prescribed medications and identified any discrepancies with a thorough analysis. Continuing educational activities such as ""dear doctor"" letters and personal consultations were used to rectify any irrational prescribing patterns among physicians. The WHO/International Network for Rational Use of Drugs core drug use indicators, specifically prescribing and patient care indicators, and established benchmarks were applied to encourage rational prescribing. RESULTS: The three most common diagnoses were pharyngitis (51.49%), allergic rhinitis (25.11%), and acute suppurative otitis media (21.17%). Montelukast, in combination with levocetirizine (13.77%) and amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid (8.81%), was the most frequently prescribed medication. The average number of drugs per prescription was 4.2% (+/-1.1), with low usage of generic names (33.0%) and suboptimal reliance on the essential drugs list (76.7%). Furthermore, patient care indicators demonstrated room for improvement, particularly concerning consultation times (6 minutes), dispensing times (30 seconds), and drug labeling practices (0% labeled). The DUE improved the prescribing rate of first-line drugs for five diseases and few aspects of prescribing and patient care indicators. CONCLUSION: There is an overuse of prescribed drugs, a need for more utilization of generic names, and less than optimal use of the essential drugs list.

39569307,2024,"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum (TP) subspecies pallidum. Syphilis can be transmitted via contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood or semen, congenital infection, blood transfusion, or organ transplantation. After a brief incubation period, the disease manifests with signs and symptoms such as genital ulcers, erythematous papules on the palms and soles, fever, and lymphadenopathy. The clinical presentation of syphilis is varied, making its diagnosis challenging. Syphilitic ulcers or erosions (hard chancres) may occur in extragenital regions, and the disease may present as isolated lymphadenopathy without skin lesions. In some cases, lymphadenopathy accompanied by elevated levels of inflammatory markers may mimic hematologic malignancies. Herein, we report a rare case of syphilis associated with genital and extragenital chancres, as well as inguinal lymphadenopathy, in a 31-year-old man. The patient developed a finger ulcer and painless swelling of the left inguinal lymph node, initially suspected to be a skin infection and treated with topical and oral antibiotics, but with poor improvement. During treatment, systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, joint pain, and loss of appetite emerged, and blood tests showed elevated C-reactive protein and soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels, suggesting suppurative lymphadenitis or hematologic malignancy. Although a lymph node biopsy was considered, a genital ulcer appeared later, raising suspicion of syphilis. TP antibodies were positive, and titers of quantitative rapid plasma reagin and TP antibodies were high, leading to a diagnosis of syphilitic chancres and lymphadenitis.

The probiotic properties of the five isolates exhibited that the survival rates in acid and bile salt concentration ranged from 56.2 to 73.7% and 55.3 to 70.3%, respectively. Similarly, the surface hydrophobicity of the isolates was 41-75%. Antibiotic assay revealed that all five isolates were resistant to Amoxicillin, Cloxacillin, and Penicillin-V. Interestingly, all the isolates except ME26 displayed susceptibility towards Penicillin (2 units) and Tetracycline (10 microg). Further, the four isolates (ME25, ME26, ME9, and ME2) had more antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus. However, only three, except ME1 and ME2, showed maximum antibacterial activity and produced more antimicrobial compounds compared to reference strain L. plantarum Pb3. The potential probiotic isolates were identified as Weisella cibaria ME9, Weisella cibaria ME26, and Weisella confusa ME25.","[('lactic acid', 'DISEASE'), ('lactic acid bacteria', 'DISEASE'), ('lactic acid', 'DISEASE'), ('salt', 'CHEMICAL'), ('salt', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Cloxacillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Weisella confusa ME25', 'DISEASE')]"
39567671,2024,"DATA SOURCES: Patient records from Wits Oral Health Centre were collected over two years (March 2019-March 2021). The records were divided into two groups: pre-COVID-19 (March 2019-March 2020) and COVID-19 (March 2020-March 2021). The total sample size was 698 systematically selected patient records who received antibiotics. STUDY SELECTION: A systematic random sampling method was used to select a sample of patients who received prescriptions for antibiotics. Patients were included based on their treatment time and need for antibiotic prescription. Patients whose records were missing information or treated by independent private practitioners for whom records access was not feasible were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The extracted data contained information regarding the patients' demographics, medical histories, dental condition, dental procedure, antibiotic type, frequency, dosage, duration of use, and prescribers' disciplines. The information was categorized and captured in Microsoft Excel to analyze and create figures and tables. Analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, chi-squared, and z-tests to compare pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 prescription patterns in RStudio. RESULTS: From an initial pool of 44,067 patient consultations, a systematic random sample of 698 records met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this study. The sample was divided between pre-COVID-19 (n = 350) and COVID-19 (n = 348). A significant increase in antibiotic prescriptions was found during COVID-19 (1571 prescriptions) compared to pre-COVID-19 (1109 prescriptions). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were amoxicillin and metronidazole. Specifically, amoxicillin was used in most cases before and during COVID-19. The combination of amoxicillin with metronidazole increased from 16.6% pre-COVID-19 to 24.4% COVID-19. It was found that many of the antibiotics prescribed from both periods were not clinically indicated (53.1% pre-COVID-19 and 54.3% COVID-19). CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased antibiotic prescriptions despite fewer in-person consultations. This was likely due to insufficient surgical intervention and reliance on antibiotics to treat dental conditions. The lack of proper antibiotic use raises concerns regarding dental practitioners' appropriate use of antibiotics. There is an urgent need for improved antibiotic stewardship to prevent the misuse and growing public health issue of antimicrobial resistance.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pandemic', 'DISEASE')]"

39564034,2024,"We present a case of a 60-year-old woman who developed invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) meningitis following a COVID-19 infection, complicated by multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS). Initially diagnosed with COVID-19 based on fever, nasal obstruction, cough, and sore throat, her symptoms improved with symptomatic treatment, except for a persistent sore throat. She later presented with hematemesis and was found to have bacterial pneumonia and dehydration. Despite treatment with ceftriaxone, her condition worsened with the development of a headache, shivering, and worsening respiratory and circulatory symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed bacterial meningitis, and treatment was escalated to include ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin. An MRI revealed a parapharyngeal space abscess, and subsequent blood cultures identified GAS as the causative organism. The patient was treated with ampicillin for 14 days, followed by oral amoxicillin. Her condition improved, and she was discharged with no neurological deficits. This case underscores the need for vigilance in detecting secondary bacterial infections in post-COVID-19 patients, especially in MIS, where atypical presentations can delay diagnosis.

39563839,2024,"PURPOSE: Helicobacter pylori infections differ between children and adults. The Pediatric society practice guidelines recommend against a test-and-treat approach, characterized by the use of non-invasive tests for diagnosis (e.g. urea breath test [UBT] or stool antigen test). However, significant variations exist in clinical practice. This study examined the use of non-invasive testing for the screening and diagnosis of H. pylori infection in children at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Singapore, reviewing both management decisions and patient outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on children between the ages of 0 and 18 years who were tested for H. pylori infection using either a stool antigen test or UBT between January 2018 and June 2020. RESULTS: Among the 1,397 children tested, 117 (8.4%) had a positive stool H. pylori antigen result, and 5 out of 85 tested (5.9%) had a positive UBT. Abdominal pain was the predominant symptom (n=98; 80.3%). Only 7 treatment-naive children had biopsy-proven disease. Tissue biopsies for H. pylori culture were sent to 2 children, with 1 negative result. A total of 111 children (91.0%) received treatment, wherein proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 14 days was the most common therapeutic regimen. Symptom resolution was observed in 62 children (50.8%).

39561736,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Beta-lactam antibiotics (BLAs) are the most common cause of drug hypersensitivity reactions in children, and it is important to find safe alternative antibiotics for these children. This study evaluates the selection, safety to alternative antibiotics in patients with confirmed BLA allergies based on diagnostic tests. METHODS: At the Pediatric Immunology and Allergy Clinic of Ankara Bilkent City Hospital, a retrospective evaluation of diagnostic tests (including skin prick, intradermal, and drug provocation tests) was conducted to identify alternative antibiotics for patients with confirmed BLA. Patients were also contacted by telephone to assess their use of these alternative drugs. RESULTS: The study included 80 patients with confirmed beta-lactam allergy (BLA). The BLAs causing reactions were categorized into two groups: penicillins (75%, n = 60) and cephalosporins (25%, n = 20). Among the penicillins, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (ACA) was the most common at 68.8%, while among the cephalosporins, ceftriaxone was the most common at 16.3%. Of the 55 patients with ACA allergy, 53 underwent controlled administration with clarithromycin, with 52 showing no reaction. In addition, no reaction was observed in patients who received DPT with cefuroxime (n: 16), phenoxymethyl penicillin (n: 9), cefdinir (n: 1), and cefixime (n: 1), while there was no reaction in the controlled administration with clindamycin. Alternative treatments were tested in 13 patients with a confirmed ceftriaxone allergy. No adverse reactions were observed in 9 patients who underwent DPT with ACA and in 10 patients who were exposed to clarithromycin under controlled conditions. Finally, 54 of the 80 patients (67.5%) were successfully contacted and none reported a reaction to the alternative drugs. CONCLUSION: For patients with confirmed BLA, macrolides may be considered as preferred alternatives. In addition, beta-lactams with different side chains may be safe alternatives after diagnostic evaluation, taking into account the risk of cross-reactivity.","[('Beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('drug hypersensitivity reactions', 'DISEASE'), ('allergies', 'DISEASE'), ('Allergy', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ACA allergy', 'DISEASE'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DPT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('phenoxymethyl penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefdinir', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefixime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DPT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('macrolides', 'CHEMICAL')]"

39559257,2024,"Background: About 80% of pregnant women use at least one medication during their pregnancy period. Many drugs that are not allowed to be used during pregnancy (from FDA Pregnancy Categories D and X) were used. Irrational use of these drugs during pregnancy may result in different birth defects, as explained by thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol's tragedy. Knowledge of drug utilization and associated factors that affect the pattern is important to enhance rational prescribing. But information about prescription patterns and associated factors among pregnant women is scarce in the Debre Tabor area and generally in Ethiopia. Objective: This study was aimed at assessing drug prescription patterns, potential teratogenicity, and associated factors among pregnant women attending the antenatal care unit at Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Debre Tabor, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study design was performed on 359 pregnant women attending antenatal care units from June 01, 2022, to August 30, 2022, in the hospital. Necessary data were obtained through a questionnaire by reviewing the medical charts of the women. Analysis of the data was performed using SPSS Version 23. The association of the independent variables to medication use was assessed using multivariate logistic regression. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Most of the study participants (325/359) were married (90.5%). From a total of 359 participants, 350 (97.5%) were prescribed with drugs. About 64% (385/602) of the prescribed medications were iron and vitamins. The most commonly prescribed medications are iron and folic acid combination (340/602, 56.5%), albendazole (48/602, 8%), mebendazole (37/602, 6.1%), omeprazole (33/602, 5.5%), followed by amoxicillin (32/602, 5.3%). The majority (79.3%) of the drugs were from FDA Pregnancy Categories A and B. Prescribed drug utilization was more probable in women who first visited the facility at their second (AOR = 2.91, 95% CI [1.12-6.64]) and third trimesters (AOR = 4.32, 95% CI [1.37-6.81]), had chronic illness (AOR = 7.54, 95% CI [2.34-14.68]), and live in rural areas (AOR = 2.47, 95% CI [1.56-8.43]). Conclusion: The study revealed that the prescription pattern in the hospital is in line with the WHO reference. Age, gravidity, number of ANC visits, first visit to the facility, presence of chronic illness, educational status, and residency were significantly associated with prescription drug use in pregnant mothers. But still, some pregnant women received drugs that may have teratogenicity risk (FDA Category C).","[('birth defects', 'DISEASE'), ('thalidomide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diethylstilbestrol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('iron', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vitamins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('iron', 'CHEMICAL'), ('folic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('albendazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('mebendazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('omeprazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chronic illness', 'DISEASE'), ('chronic illness', 'DISEASE')]"

39558419,2024,"BACKGROUND: A simple suspension method, where solid formulations are disintegrated and suspended by being soaked in warm water followed by tube administration, is widely used, especially for elderly patients with dysphagia in Japanese clinical settings. However, there is insufficient information on drug stability in the simple co-suspension of multiple formulations especially including acidic or alkaline ones. The influence of occasional prolonged soakage on drug stability is also of concern. In this study, the chemical stability of typical beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin, and cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride, was investigated in simple co-suspensions with magnesium oxide (MgO), which is frequently used as an alkaline laxative for the elderly. METHODS: Amoxicillin (capsule) or cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride (tablet) was placed with or without MgO (tablet) in a centrifuge tube containing warm water (55  degrees C). The tube was allowed to stand for 10 min or 5 h at room temperature and simple suspensions were prepared. The suspensions were then treated with large amounts of solvents and neutralized using a weakly acidic cation exchange resin. The resulting solutions were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The degradation products were identified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: Amoxicillin was found to be partially degraded to amoxicilloic acid and amoxicillin diketopiperazine by the co-suspension with MgO. The degree of degradation increased with the prolonged soaking. The recovery rates of cefcapene pivoxil decreased due to the poor solubility in the co-suspensions with MgO and no degradation product of the drug was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin and MgO should be independently suspended because of the chemical instability of amoxicillin. This study has also indicated there is a degradation risk after prolonged soaking. It should be noted that the poor water solubility of cefcapene pivoxil under alkaline conditions may affect the absorption process as well as tube passability.","[('dysphagia', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride', 'CHEMICAL'), ('magnesium oxide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MgO', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MgO', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicilloic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin diketopiperazine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefcapene pivoxil', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MgO', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MgO', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefcapene pivoxil', 'CHEMICAL')]"

39551740,2024,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common however the widespread use of antibiotics has led to a rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) amongst uropathogens, rendering a significant proportion of infections resistant to first line treatment. AMR in UTIs may differentially affect men and women, younger and older patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate MDR (multi-drug resistance) and AMR in males and females in an Australian health district. METHODS: There were 85,844 E. coli urinary isolates (2007-2020) analysed from adult patients. An E. coli isolate with MDR was defined as resistant to at least 1 agent in >/= 3 antimicrobial classes. Chi-square tests and relative risk were calculated by comparing resistance in males and females and by age for antibiotics commonly used to treat UTIs in hospital and community collected samples. RESULTS: There was a higher proportion of MDR E. coli in males compared to females in both the community (6.4% vs. 5.2%, P < 0.001) and hospital datasets (16.5% vs. 12.8%, P < 0.001). The proportions of MDR for both males and females were significantly higher in the hospital setting. Resistance rates were higher in males compared to females for amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalexin and norfloxacin (p < 0.005), though not for trimethoprim. Antibiotic resistance was seen to increase over time.

Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) with light-activated photosensitizers has emerged as a strategy to combat resistant bacteria, challenging the intrinsic heterogeneity of bacterial populations. This study evaluates the impact of PDI on both heterogeneity and shape of the distribution profile of resistant bacterial populations, specifically on strains of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to amoxicillin, erythromycin, and gentamicin, for exploring its potential as an adjuvant therapy in the fight against bacterial resistance. Curcumin (10 microM) was used as a photosensitizer and five cycles of PDI were applied on Staphylococcus aureus strains under 450 nm irradiation of 10 J/cm(2) energy density. The resistance variations amongst bacterial subpopulations were investigated by calculating the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) before and after PDI treatment. MIC was significantly reduced by the antibiotics tested post-PDI and a reduction in the heterogeneity of bacterial populations was recorded, suggesting PDI can effectively decrease the resistance diversity of Staphylococcus aureus. The result reinforces the potential of PDI as a valuable adjuvant therapy, offering a promising avenue for mitigating bacterial resistance and promoting more effective treatment strategies against resistant infections.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Curcumin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('PDI', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE')]"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center double-blinded RCT study with parallel groups was undertaken. Eighty-two patients fulfilled study inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to the amoxicillin (n = 41) or clindamycin (n = 41) group. The primary outcome variable was early implant failure. The presence of infection was evaluated immediately after surgery and on days 7, 14, 30, and 90, and postoperative pain/inflammation was assessed daily on days 1 to 7 post-surgery. Resonance frequency analysis was used to measure primary and secondary implant stability. RESULTS: One early implant failure was observed (1/81), in a patient from the amoxicillin group. No statistically significant between-group differences were observed in early implant failure rate, postoperative infection rate up to 90 days, pain/inflammation scores during the first week post-surgery, or primary or secondary stability values. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of 600 mg clindamycin before implant surgery does not increase the risk of early implant failure or infection.

Compared with a control with no veterinary antibiotics, the amoxicillin and doxycycline groups presented no significant effects on biogas production, methane production, VFA concentration, acetic acid concentration or the pH of the AD system (P > 0.05). However, compared with the control, the ciprofloxacin groups presented significantly inhibited biogas and methane production during AD (P < 0.05), and the H(CIP) and L(CIP) groups presented significantly decreased biogas (47.82% and 45.37%, respectively) and methane (58.24% and 52.55%, respectively) production (P < 0.05). Moreover, the VFA and acetic acid concentrations of the ciprofloxacin groups were significantly higher than those of control during the entire AD period (P < 0.05), and the pH value at the withdrawal stage was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.01), with no significant difference between the H(CIP) and L(CIP) groups (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that ciprofloxacin causes VFA and acetic acid accumulation in AD systems, thereby reducing the pH of the systems and inhibiting methanogen growth, ultimately reducing methane production in the AD systems.

All gastric biopsies showed superficial lamina propria infiltration with plasma cells and lymphocytes. Active gastritis with neutrophils infiltration was seen in 75% of the cases. Gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia were uncommon histopathological findings (8.5% and 1%, respectively). The eradication rates for TT, ST, HT, CT, and CTT were 70%, 77.5%, 80%, 85%, and 90%, respectively, with the latter achieving a statistically significant difference when compared with TT (p = 0.025). The rate of occurrence of adverse effects among different regimens was not statistically different. CONCLUSION: As an empirical treatment for children with H. pylori infection, CTT is safe and provides the highest eradication rate. HT, ST, and CT might not be superior to TT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered at the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, Cochrane South Africa, under the identifier PACTR202201686010590. Date of registration: 04 January 2022. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Triple therapy has been the standard eradication regimen for pediatric H. pylori infection. The efficacy of triple therapy has decreased in many countries due to increased antibiotic resistance. WHAT IS NEW: * This randomized controlled trial is the first to compare triple therapy, sequential therapy, hybrid therapy, concomitant therapy, and ciprofloxacin-based triple therapy for the eradication of pediatric H. pylori infection. Triple therapy exhibited the lowest eradication rate among the studied regimens, suggesting it may not be an adequate therapeutic option for infected children. Ciprofloxacin-based triple therapy appears to be a safe and effective therapeutic choice for pediatric H. pylori infection. Additionally, this study provides the first reported eradication rate of hybrid therapy in pediatric H. pylori infection.","[('Helicobacter pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('HT', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('HT', 'DISEASE'), ('epigastric pain', 'DISEASE'), ('erythema', 'DISEASE'), ('gastritis', 'DISEASE'), ('Gastric atrophy', 'DISEASE'), ('HT', 'DISEASE'), ('H. pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('HT', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE')]"

Following a single fever spike, blood cultures identified P. micra, although no other systemic features of IE were present. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrated vegetation on the mitral valve, and a dental assessment led to the extraction of two retained roots. The patient was treated with intravenous benzylpenicillin for six weeks, followed by oral amoxicillin, totaling three months of antibiotic therapy.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old yellow female experienced acute binocular visual acuity decrease after 1 day of high fever, and binocular visual acuity decreased to index or anterior. OCT in the external hospital showed dome-shaped cortical detachment in the symmetrical macular area of both eyes with subretinal fluid, discontinuity in the ellipsoid zone and the chimera. The patient autonomously administered antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including amoxicillin and ibuprofen. Following a three-day period, the patient's visual acuity demonstrated significant improvement. Additionally, macular edema demonstrated a notable reduction as indicated by optical coherence tomography, while the presence of peripheral retinal vascular occlusions was also observed on fluorescein fundus angiography. At the onset of 6 days, oral hormone therapy was given in the outside hospital, with no significant improvement in visual acuity.23 days after the onset of the disease, the patient was admitted to our hospital, and was finally diagnosed as acute idiopathic maculopathy combined with the imaging findings of FFA, ICGA and OCT. During the follow-up, the visual acuity of both eyes improved spontaneously.

39543399,2024,"DATA SOURCES: Three databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) were searched in December 2021 for 16 Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs). STUDY SELECTION: Three reviewers reviewed the articles on oral antibiotic prophylaxis (ABP) for the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) and dry socket (DS) after lower third molar (L3M) extraction using the PICO framework. From 1999 to 2021, RCTs involving healthy patients undergoing L3M extraction with ABP, placebo, or no therapy were included. Adverse effects (AEs) associated with antibiotic usage, along with the main outcomes (DS and SSI), were also documented. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three independent investigators selected articles based on pre-established inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by consensus or additional researchers. PRISMA guidelines were followed, involving initial title and abstract screening, followed by full-text evaluation. Exclusion reasons were documented, and the most recent report was included when multiple reports on the same patients were found, with no language restrictions applied. Two investigators evaluated studies quality and quality of evidence respectively using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and GRADEpro GDT. They independently extracted data, focusing on the type of extraction and the number of extracted L3M. They also detailed the use of antibiotics, including dosage, dosage regimen, timing, and duration. Among 16 articles, 15 used a parallel arm design, while one used a crossover design. The antibiotics studied included Amoxicillin+Clavulanic acid (7 articles), Amoxicillin (6), Metronidazole (2), Azithromycin (1), and Clindamycin (2), all compared with no treatment or placebo. A pairwise meta-analysis was used to combine studies with equivalent treatment (direct estimation), and a network meta-analysis compared outcome variables across different treatments (indirect comparison). RESULTS: Two included articles had a low risk of bias and the level of evidence was low according to GRADE. Pooled results supported the use of antibiotics to reduce DS and SSI following L3M extraction with a number needed to treat 25 and 18, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that ABP reduces the risk of DS and SSI, it is recommended to consider systemic conditions and individual patient risk factors before prescribing antibiotics, due to global health threat.","[('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('SSI', 'DISEASE')]"

39540231,2024,"The swift and stable detection of pathogens in urine samples holds significant implications for the immediate clinical diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). In this study, we propose a detection strategy utilizing a hybrid substrate composed of graphene oxide (GO) and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) for the detection of pathogens subjected to amoxicillin-mediated (amo-mediated) treatment. This strategy employs dynamic surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (D-SERS) for stable and rapid detection, capturing signal variations induced by amo-mediated changes in pathogen morphology. During the 5 min D-SERS detection time window, stable SERS signals were detected for three types of pathogens and four types of pathogens were successfully distinguished using principal component analysis (PCA). In comparison to conventional nanosubstrates, the GO/Ag NP hybrid substrate exhibits outstanding stability and enhancement effects. This approach enables the dual detection of the pathogen cell structure and metabolites, facilitating specific identification of pathogens in the urinary tract, with a detection limit for Escherichia coli reaching 1 x 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, meeting the clinical microbiology laboratory diagnostic standards for UTIs (10(5) CFU/mL). Testing of 188 clinically collected urine samples using this strategy yielded a sensitivity (SENS) of 86.4% and a specificity (SPC) of 89.7%. This introduces a novel method for diagnosing UTIs, offering broad applications in the field of clinical pathogen detection.","[('urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('graphene oxide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('silver', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ag', 'CHEMICAL'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE')]"

Unlike previous studies on this topic, our study specifically delves into the effectiveness and drawbacks of various treatment approaches such as traditional wastewater treatment facilities (WWTP), membrane bioreactors (MBRs), constructed wetlands (CW), and moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR). Through the examination and synthesis of information gathered from more than 200 research studies, we have created a comprehensive database that delves into the effectiveness of eliminating 19 particular PhCs, including commonly studied compounds such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, ketoprofen, indomethacin, salicylic acid, codeine, and fenoprofen, amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, atenolol, propranolol, and metoprolol. This resource provides a depth and scope of information that was previously lacking in this area of study. Notably, among these pharmaceuticals, azithromycin demonstrated the highest removal rates across all examined treatment systems, with the exception of WWTPs, while carbamazepine consistently exhibited the lowest removal efficiencies across various systems. The analysis showcases the diverse results in removal efficiency impacted by factors such as system configuration, operation specifics, and environmental circumstances. The findings emphasize the critical need for continued innovation and research, specifically recommending the integration of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) with existing biological treatment methods to improve the breakdown of recalcitrant compounds like carbamazepine.

39537907,2024,"DESIGN: This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis that assesses systemic antimicrobials: azithromycin (AZT) and amoxicillin/metronidazole (AMX/MTZ), as adjuvants to subgingival instrumentation in the treatment of periodontitis. The aim is to establish if one antimicrobial is superior as an adjuvant therapy in the management of periodontal disease. STUDY SELECTION: This systematic review and meta-analysis included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, and prospective and retrospective human studies. Participants had to be adults (>/=18 years of age) with a diagnosis of periodontitis in the categories: chronic/aggressive, stages II/III, grades B/C. All participants completed full mouth subgingival instrumentation (SI) with the use of adjunct systemic antimicrobial therapy: the intervention group: AZT and the control group: AMX/MTZ. A total of 779 studies were retrieved from the data search; following the application of selection criteria and independent review duplicated by two authors, seven studies were eligible for review. Two studies were subsequently excluded due to insufficient information. Therefore five studies were included in the review, all were self-funded and four were conducted in recognised universities. DATA ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure was probing pocket depth changes at 1-12 months. Secondary outcome measures were: the number of residual sites with pocket depths >/=5 mm, clinical attachment levels, bleeding on probing, plaque indices (at 1-12 months), and occurrence of adverse events. Review Manager Software (The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to conduct meta-analysis. Heterogeneity between studies was expected, therefore the random-effects model was utilised to pool results from multiple studies. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and Cochrane's test for heterogeneity. The certainty of evidence was assessed and a summary of GRADE criteria: risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias. Bias was graded for the five studies included in this meta-analysis and systematic review. Two studies were low risk, two were moderate risk and one was high risk. The study rated high for risk of bias was due to an incomplete description of blinding. Three of the studies were rated low bias for outcome measurement as they reported blinding of data assessors. No studies had deviations from the intended interventions and all outcomes were detected; therefore, all studies were rated as low bias for these domains. RESULTS: All five of the studies demonstrated changing in probing pocket depths at 1-3 months, however, the intervention and control cohorts showed no significant difference. One study showed a statistically significant difference in probing pocket depths at 12 months, in favour of AZT. This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates no statistically significant difference between the two cohorts: AZT and AMX/MTZ for mean changes in clinical attachment level, probing pocket depths or bleeding on probing at 1-3 months; when used as an adjunct to mechanical intervention in the treatment of periodontitis. It was recorded, evidence of low to moderate certainty, that for the AZT cohort: fewer adverse events were evident and fewer sites with residual probing pocket depths of >/=5 mm at 1-3 months were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis, there is no statistically significant superior drug therapy, comparing the use of AZT versus AMX/MTZ as an adjunct in the treatment of periodontists. However, evidence of low to moderate certainty demonstrates fewer adverse events and fewer sites with residual pocket depths >/=5 mm at 1-3 months in the AZT cohort, compared to the AMX/MTZ cohort. A greater number of clinical trials and a stronger evidence base in the future will allow for authentication of current findings.","[('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AZT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontal disease', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('chronic/aggressive', 'DISEASE'), ('AZT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bleeding', 'DISEASE'), ('bias', 'DISEASE'), ('AZT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AZT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bleeding', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('AZT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AZT', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AZT', 'CHEMICAL')]"

DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to collect AMC data for three financial years with respective denominators. The data were computed using the AMC Tool 2019 v1.9.0 and defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID). SETTING: The BMH, Dodoma, Tanzania. PARTICIPANTS: This study surveyed quantities of antimicrobials procured at the BMH. It did not have any human participants. OUTCOME MEASURES: AMC was quantified in DID. The comparisons were made based on the DID of all surveyed antimicrobials, taking into account oral and parenteral administration and based on pharmacological classes. Further, DIDs were presented based on the 2023 WHO Access (A), Watch (W) and Reserve (R) (AWaRe) classification. RESULTS: In 29 assessed antimicrobials, the DIDs for 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 were 3.0852, 3.5892 and 3.9213, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine samples from canine and feline patients with clinical signs of urinary tract infection were collected between September 2015 and December 2019 in Santiago, Chile. Bacterial identification and bacterial susceptibility profile was performed through biochemical and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-six samples from dogs (37.7%) and 152 from cats (26.1%) showed bacterial growth. Positive samples were mainly from females (dogs: 52.8%; cats: 48.0%), with the highest infection rates in senior dogs (57.7%) and adult cats (45.4%). A single organism caused the infection in 78.2% of the cases, whereas the remaining 21.8% corresponded to a mixed infection.

Biofilms exhibit increased resistance to antimicrobials relative to single planktonic cells, emphasizing the need for effective biofilm removal during periodontal therapy for peri-implantitis treatment. To tackle this issue, our team evaluated the effectiveness of low-temperature plasma (LTP) for disinfecting titanium discs contaminated with multispecies biofilms associated with peri-implantitis, specifically focusing on biofilms matured for 14 and 21 days as well as biofilms that had formed on Straumann(Ⓡ) Ti-SLA implants for 21 days. The biofilms included Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus oralis, and Veillonella dispar, which were grown in anaerobic conditions. These biofilms were subjected to LTP treatment for 1, 3, and 5 min, using distances of 3 or 10 mm from the LTP nozzle to the samples. Control groups included biofilms formed on Ti discs or implants that received no treatment, exposure to argon flow at 3 or 10 mm of distance for 1, 3, or 5 min, application for 1 min of 14 mug/mL amoxicillin, 140 mug/mL metronidazole, or a blend of both, and treatment with 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX) for 1 min. For the implants, 21-day-old biofilms were treated with 0.12% CHX 0.12% for 1 min and LTP for 1 min at a distance of 3 mm for each quadrant. Biofilm viability was assessed through bacterial counting and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The impact of LTP was investigated on reconstituted oral epithelia (ROE) contaminated with P. gingivalis, evaluating cytotoxicity, cell viability, and histology. The results showed that a 1 min exposure to LTP at distances of 3 or 10 mm significantly lowered bacterial counts on implants and discs compared to the untreated controls (p < 0.017). LTP exposure yielded lower levels of cytotoxicity relative to the untreated contaminated control after 12 h of contamination (p = 0.038), and cell viability was not affected by LTP (p >/= 0.05); thus, LTP-treated samples were shown to be safe for tissue applications, with low cytotoxicity and elevated cell viability post-treatment, and these results were validated by qualitative histological analysis. In conclusion, the study's results support the effectiveness of 1 min LTP exposure in successfully disinfecting mature peri-implantitis multispecies biofilms on titanium discs and implants.

Despite said treatment, the existing methods fail to eliminate potentially dangerous contaminants. As such, this study assessed the impact of long-term TWW irrigation (5 and 25 years) on soil physicochemical properties and bacterial resistance to heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Cd) and antibiotics (tetracycline and amoxicillin). The results revealed heightened salinity and conductivity and reduced pH in irrigated soils. TWW induces harmful effects by reducing microbial density and size, leading to the disappearance of sensitive populations. Conversely, resilient populations, which mainly utilize antibiotics as a carbon source, have adapted. Metagenomic 16S amplicon sequencing analysis demonstrated a shift, notably reducing Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes while increasing Acidobacteriota and Patescibacteria in treated soils. Operational Taxonomic Units affiliated with either Halomonadacea, or Saccharimonadacea and Vicinamibacteracea, were defined as indicators of the absence or presence of TWW contamination, respectively.

Vonoprazan (VPZ), a potassium-competitive acid blocker, provides higher gastric acid suppression than PPIs. We performed a meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of VPZ in H. pylori eradication therapies. METHODS: Studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to June 2023. Efficacy was evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis. Data were combined by meta-analyzing risk differences (RD). Heterogeneity was evaluated by subgrouping. RESULTS: Seventy-seven studies (24 randomized clinical trials) evaluated 44,162 patients (22,297 receiving VPZ and 21,865 PPIs). Overall VPZ efficacy was 88% (95% CI = 87%-90%): 86%, 88%, and 94% for dual/triple/quadruple-VPZ-containing therapies. VPZ efficacy was 87% (86%-89%) in first-line and 90% (87%-93%) in rescue therapy. VPZ performed better than PPIs in treatment-naive patients (87% vs. 70%; RD = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.11-0.15) and when using triple regimens. No significant differences were observed in rescue and quadruple therapies. In patients with clarithromycin-resistant infection, VPZ-based therapies demonstrated an 81% efficacy (76%-85%), surpassing PPIs (76% vs. 40%; RD = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.24-0.43). For clarithromycin-susceptible strains, VPZ efficacy was 92% (89%-95%), similar to PPIs. VPZ adverse events rate was 19% (16%-21%), comparable to PPI-based regimens (18% vs. 13%, respectively; RD = 0.00, 95% CI = -0.01 to 0.02, p = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of VPZ-based regimens was over 85% in all treatment combinations. In treatment-naive and clarithromycin-resistant patients, VPZ performed better than PPIs. In rescue therapy, in clarithromycin-susceptible patients or when quadruple regimens were prescribed, this advantage was not confirmed. Tolerability was similar in both regimens.","[('Helicobacter pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('quadruple', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin-resistant infection', 'DISEASE'), ('PPI-based', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin-resistant', 'CHEMICAL'), ('quadruple', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39531464,2024,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is an acute gastroenteritis infection and one of Ethiopia's most common causes of morbidity and mortality, especially in children under five. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has spread quickly among Shigella species due to inappropriate antibiotic use, inadequacies of diagnostic facilities, and unhygienic conditions. This study aimed to characterize Shigella sonnei (S. sonnei) using whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: The raw reads were quality-filtered and trimmed, and a minimum length of 50bp was retained and taxonomically classified using MiniKraken version 1. The whole genome data were aligned with Antibiotic Resistance Gene (ARG) sequences of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) by Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI). Plasmids were analyzed using the PlasmidFinder tool version 2.1. Additionally, AMR and virulence genes were screened at the Centre for Genomic Epidemiology (CGE) web-based server. RESULTS: All isolates in our investigation contained genes encoding blaEC-8 and blaZEG-1. Here, 60.7% of the isolates were phenotypically sensitive to cefoxitin among the blaEC-8 genes detected in the genotyping analysis, whereas all isolates were completely resistant to amoxicillin and erythromycin phenotypically. The study also identified genes that conferred resistance to trimethoprim (dfrA). Plasmid Col156 and Col (BS512) types were found in all isolates, while IncFII and Col (MG828) plasmids were only identified in one isolate. CONCLUSION: This study found that many resistant genes were present, confirming the high variety in S. sonnei strains and hence a divergence in phylogenetic relationships. Thus, combining WGS methods for AMR prediction and strain identification into active surveillance may be beneficial for monitoring the spread of AMR in S. sonnei and detecting the potential emergence of novel variations.","[('Shigellosis', 'DISEASE'), ('acute gastroenteritis infection', 'DISEASE'), ('cefoxitin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39528737,2024,"This study collected ten treated wastewater samples from Vinh Long General Hospital to determine their physicochemical characteristics and antibiotic properties. All treated wastewater samples collected during the monitoring periods complied with national regulations. In addition, these samples did not contain bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio cholerae. The investigation yielded a total of 25 Escherichia coli isolates. The E. coli isolates exhibied highest antibiotic resistance rate to ampicillin (100%), followed by ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and cefazolin (96%, 92%, and 92%, respectively). The resistance rate to fosfomycin was 88%, whereas 80% of the isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The resistance rate to gentamicin was 72%, whereas that to imipenem and tetracycline was 52%. In addition, 44% isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, and 32% of isolates were colistin-resistant. Among analyzed isolates, three were resistant to 10 of 11 tested antibiotics but only displayed intermediate resistance to imipenems (carbapenems). Surprisingly, 23 out of 25 isolates showed a positive ESBL phenotype. Eleven of them had both the bla(TEM) and bla(CTX-M-1) group structural genes, while twelve only had the bla(CTX-M-1) group gene. Furthermore, none of the isolated E. coli isolates exhibited the bla(SHV) gene. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of colistin exceeded 4 mug/mL in 8 out of 25 (32%) isolates.

39528337,2024,"PURPOSE: To investigate antibiotic usage practices in ophthalmic surgeries in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent to veterinary surgeons (general veterinarians and veterinarians with additional qualification in ophthalmology) inquiring about their antibiotic preferences, administration methods, and factors affecting antibiotic usage in ophthalmic surgical procedures. RESULTS: A total of 417 questionnaires were analyzed. Postoperative antibiotics (systemic/topical in percent when used) were used all or most of the time by 69% of veterinarians following enucleation (99/6), by 62% after eyelid surgery (54/69), by 68% after third eyelid (TEL) surgery (19/92) and by 80% after keratectomy (6/99). The most commonly used systemic antibiotic was amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and the most commonly used topical antibiotic was chloramphenicol. WHO ""watch-group"" antibiotics were infrequently administered systemically but frequently utilized topically; including in 13% of eyelid surgery, 15% of TEL surgery, and 35% of keratectomies. Factors influencing antibiotic use included fear of complications (67%), personal experience (63%), diagnostic uncertainty (21%), and owner expectations (9%). Participants following institutional guidelines used fewer antibiotics in enucleations (p = .002) and were less likely to choose fluoroquinolones post-eyelid surgery (p = .044). CONCLUSION: The potential for reducing antibiotic use following ophthalmic soft tissue surgery is significant. Addressing barriers such as concerns about postoperative complications and the reliance on individual clinical experience, the implementation of standardized guidelines could facilitate a shift toward more judicious antibiotic practices.","[('chloramphenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('postoperative complications', 'DISEASE')]"
39525839,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a critical public health concern in Ethiopia, contributing to high morbidity and mortality rates among children. Despite the improvement in hospital coverage and the development of standardized WHO treatment guidelines, recent reviews indicated a wide range in recovery rates (34%-88%) due to several context-specific factors. Understanding the factors influencing the recovery time can help inform targeted interventions and improve the overall management of SAM cases. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the time to recovery and predictors of children aged 6-59 months with severe acute malnutrition in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 2023. METHODS: An institutional-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among children aged 6-59 months who were admitted to Tirunesh Beijing Hospital (TBH), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from July 2019 to June 2023. The Kaplan-Meir estimate and survival curve were used to compare the time to recovery using a log-rank test among different characteristics. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis model was used to identify significant predictors of time to recovery. Finally, a p-value of <0.05 was used to declare a significant association. RESULTS: The median survival time to recovery was 17 (95% CI: 16.39-17.60) days, and the incidence rate of recovery from SAM was 37.8 per 1,000 child days. Moreover, exclusive breastfeeding [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.97, 95% CI: 1.45-2.68], amoxicillin provision (aHR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.11-2.35), and deworming (aHR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.48-3.09) were protective factors. However, complications at admission (aHR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.23-0.73) and diarrhea during admission (aHR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.45-0.91) were identified as risk factors of recovery from SAM. CONCLUSION: The time to recovery among the current study participants was low compared with the sphere standard. Besides, exclusive breastfeeding, complications at admission, diarrhea, amoxicillin provision, and deworming were independent predictors. Therefore, appropriate provision of routine medication and early management of medical comorbidity as per the national SAM management protocol can reduce the mortality of children with severe acute malnutrition significantly.","[('malnutrition', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('comorbidity', 'DISEASE')]"
39523458,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Few studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of tegoprazan-amoxicillin (TA) dual therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different dosages of TA dual therapy for H. pylori eradication. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study was conducted at four centers in Fujian, China. H. pylori-infective patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive one of the following treatments: bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT, esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily + potassium bismuth citrate 240 mg twice daily + amoxicillin 1 g twice daily + clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily), tegoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapies (TA-qd, tegoprazan 50 mg once daily + amoxicillin 1 g thrice daily; TA-bid, tegoprazan 50 mg twice daily + amoxicillin 1 g thrice daily) for 14 days. The primary outcome was noninferiority in eradication rates of the different TA groups compared to the BQT group. Secondary outcomes encompassed an assessment of adverse reactions and clinical symptom relief. Additionally, exploratory outcomes were focused on the shifts in gut microbiota and a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: A total of 321 patients were enrolled. The eradication rates in the BQT group, TA-qd group, and TA-bid group were 85.05% (91/107), 85.98% (92/107), and 85.98% (92/107) in the intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) (BQT vs. TA-qd, 95% CI -8.50% to 10.36%, noninferiority p = 0.012; BQT vs. TA-bid, 95% CI -8.50% to 10.36%, noninferiority p = 0.012); 91.00% (91/100), 91.09% (92/101), and 92.93% (92/99) in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (mITT) (BQT vs. TA-qd, 95% CI -7.81% to 7.98%, noninferiority p = 0.006; BQT vs. TA-bid, 95% CI -5.62% to 9.48%, noninferiority p < 0.001); 90.81% (89/98), 91.00% (91/100), and 93.81% (91/97) in the per-protocol analysis (PP) (BQT vs. TA-qd, 95% CI -7.83% to 8.19%, noninferiority p = 0.006; BQT vs. TA-bid, 95% CI 4.46% to 10.46%, noninferiority p < 0.001). The incidence of adverse reactions in the TA-qd and TA-bid groups was significantly lower than in the BQT group (13.33%, 14.56%, and 27.18%, respectively; p = 0.017). The complete remissions of clinical symptoms for BQT, TA-qd, and TA-bid were 36.89%, 65.71%, and 68.93%, respectively, had significant differences (p < 0.001). Two weeks of TA therapy altered gut microbiota diversity and composition, but that recovered 4 weeks after discontinuation. The cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) for BQT, TA-qd, and TA-bid were 1.85 CNY, 2.08 CNY, and 3.69 CNY, respectively. CONCLUSION: Both TA dual therapies provided satisfactory eradication rates of > 90% for eradicating H. pylori, fewer adverse reactions, and greater clinical symptom relief compared to BQT, with a mild, reversible impact on gut microbiota. In addition, the TA dual therapy with low doses of tegoprazan showed better cost-effectiveness.

39520902,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Colonic actinomycosis is an uncommon chronic infection associated with granulomatous inflammation resulting multiple abscesses and sinuses. Common modes of presentation include weight loss, malaise, abdominal pain, and abdominal mass, which might mimic neoplasia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female presented with painful lump in right iliac fossa (RIF) for 3 weeks and acute complete bowel obstruction for 3 days. Examination revealed hard, irregular and fixed lump in the RIF. Ultrasonography of abdomen and pelvis showed ileocecal mass while contract enhanced computed tomography (CECT) suggested carcinoma transverse colon with mesenteric metastasis. The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy and right extended hemicolectomy for densely adherent mass incorporating distal ileum, cecum, ascending and proximal transverse colon with adjacent mesenteries. However, histopathological examination revealed colonic actinomycosis. The patient was commenced on intravenous penicillin G followed by oral amoxicillin. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Colonic actinomycosis is a rare infection presenting with pain abdomen, change in bowel habit, and rarely, abdominal mass. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult due to lack of pathognomonic clinical, laboratory and radiological findings. Differentiation from other diseases such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, colon carcinoma, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis is challenging. Diagnosis is confirmed histologically by presence of Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Grocott- positive sulphur granules with filaments. Newer molecular diagnoses are under study. Medical therapy is main line of treatment, most effectively with parenteral and oral beta lactams. CONCLUSION: Actinomycosis may present with aggressive invasion and infiltration of adjacent organs, mesentery, and abdominal wall mimicking malignancy. Acute presentation with bowel obstruction would mandate surgical intervention.","[('actinomycosis', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('granulomatous inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('weight loss', 'DISEASE'), ('abdominal pain', 'DISEASE'), ('neoplasia', 'DISEASE'), ('painful lump in right iliac fossa', 'DISEASE'), ('carcinoma transverse colon with mesenteric metastasis', 'DISEASE'), ('colonic actinomycosis', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('actinomycosis', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pain', 'DISEASE'), ('appendicitis', 'DISEASE'), ('diverticulitis', 'DISEASE'), ('colon carcinoma', 'DISEASE'), (""Crohn's disease"", 'DISEASE'), ('ulcerative colitis', 'DISEASE'), ('sulphur', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Actinomycosis', 'DISEASE'), ('malignancy', 'DISEASE'), ('bowel obstruction', 'DISEASE')]"
39520672,2025,"PURPOSE: Pediatric prescribing is often weight and indication specific and has been associated with high rates of error. The aim of this study was to evaluate outpatient beta-lactam suspension dosing practices for pediatric upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), to characterize the rate of error and to describe common error types. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a community health system with 2 emergency departments and 20 outpatient family medicine practices. Pediatric patients treated from these settings with oral suspension formulations of amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefdinir, or cephalexin for streptococcal pharyngitis or otitis media between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2023, were eligible for inclusion. Doses were evaluated against indication-specific best-practice guidelines and assessed for guideline concordance. RESULTS: Of the 200 patients evaluated, 100 were treated for streptococcal pharyngitis and 100 were treated for otitis media. Of the prescribed beta-lactam doses, 32% were discordant with best-practice guideline recommendations. Dosing errors were more common for pharyngitis than for otitis media (47% vs 17%; P < 0.001). Overdosing was the most frequently observed error in pharyngitis prescriptions (93.6% of errors) and most commonly occurred in patients weighing more than the 20-kg weight associated with the dosing maximum (80.9% of overdosing errors). All patients receiving an inappropriate dose for otitis media were underdosed. CONCLUSION: Outpatient pediatric dosing errors for URI indications are common among both emergency medicine and family medicine prescribers. Patients weighing over the weight corresponding to the dosing maximum are at highest risk for error. Antimicrobial stewardship interventions targeting the point of prescribing are urgently needed to provide safe dosing practices for pediatric patients.","[('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('upper respiratory tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefdinir', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalexin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('streptococcal pharyngitis', 'DISEASE'), ('otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('streptococcal pharyngitis', 'DISEASE'), ('otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pharyngitis', 'DISEASE'), ('otitis', 'DISEASE'), ('pharyngitis', 'DISEASE'), ('otitis', 'DISEASE')]"

Objective: We aimed to evaluate the clinical features and DPT results of children with a history of low-risk non-immediate reactions (NIR) to BLA who underwent initial direct single therapeutic dose challenge with a 5-day prolonged DPT. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated children ages 0-18 years with a history of low-risk NIRs to BLAs. On the first day of provocation, a single-dose DPT protocol without any skin test was administered at the clinic. The therapeutic dose was adjusted to not exceed the maximum single-unit dose (MSUD) for age and weight. The DPT protocol was administered with 100% of MSUD. To identify children with delayed reactions, the parents or caregivers were told to continue giving the medication at home for 5 days. Results: One hundred and nine children were included in this study. The median (interquartile range) age of the children was 62.5 months (26.5-94 months). Of the suspected drugs, the main culprit drug was amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 89 children (81.7%). The most common clinical manifestation was maculopapular exanthema, which occurred in 85 children (78%), and 8 (7.3%) had a positive DPT result. Three children (2.8%) developed a reaction after the first DPT dose. The remaining children continued to use the suspected BLA at home. Five children (4.7%) developed a reaction while using the drug at home. All the children with positive DPT results developed mild cutaneous signs and presented with a reaction to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. None had a systemic or severe cutaneous reaction.

The complexity of these infections lies in their polymicrobial nature, high rates of persistence and recurrence. This study examined the microbiological profile of diabetic foot osteomyelitis from a teaching hospital in Northwest England and their resistance patterns to understand its impact on infection persistence and to direct effective treatment. METHODS: A retrospective review of 105 patients who underwent surgical management for diabetic foot osteomyelitis between 2019 and 2024. We analysed three consecutive culture samples for each patient to assess for the microbiological profile and resistance patterns of these infections and to monitor infection recurrence and persistence rates. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients were identified. Infection eradication was noted in 42% of the cohort, infection persistence in 18%, and late infection recurrence in 40%. Polymicrobial growth was evident in 72% of our study sample. Gram-positive bacteria made up the majority of the bacterial isolates in all 3 culture samples, 74.81% in sample 1, 69.31% in sample 2, and 55.1% in sample 3. Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent gram-positive bacteria, at 52.38% in sample 1, 36.19% in sample 2, and 18.09% in sample 3, followed by Haemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Corynebacterium. The frequently identified gram-negative bacteria were Pseudomonas in sample 1 (7.61%), E. coli and Proteus in sample 2 (5,71%), Pseudomonas and Proteus in sample 3 (2.85%). Gram-positive bacteria were resistant to penicillin and macrolides with resistance of staphylococcus aureus to clarithromycin identified among all 3 culture samples. Gram-negative bacteria were most resistant to amoxicillin. Staphylococcus aureus was responsible for infection persistence in most of our cohort (12/19) 63.15%. Among those patients, Staphylococcus was resistant to clarithromycin in 6 of the cases. The 5-year mortality rate for our study sample was 32.38%.

OBJECTIVE: To perform chemical and physical stability studies on 16 parenteral antibiotics for skin testing purposes, with an overall aim to provide practical recommendations to clinicians on suitable components, storage, and optimal shelf-life of such preparations. METHODS: Chemical stability was assessed via validated stability-indicating high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection assays, while absence of precipitations or haziness, significant pH shift, and color change were used to determine physical stability. RESULTS: Other than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, all of the parenteral antibiotics were found to have adequate physicochemical stability between 2 and 7 days. Amoxicillin in water for injection BP retained more than 90% stability, whereas amoxicillin/clavulanic acid dropped to less than 80%. Ampicillin remained more than 90% stable for 2 days, and benzylpenicillin, flucloxacillin, and piperacillin/tazobactam were stable for 2 days or more at approximately 95%. Cephalosporins were stable for 2 days, except ceftazidime, which increased to more than 110%. Aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin retained more than 95% stability for 7 days, whereas meropenem was stable for 2 days. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in plastic syringe lost 15% but stabilized at approximately 85% for 7 days. No precipitation occurred, but amoxicillin/clavulanic acid changed color by day 2. pH decreases of 1.0 unit or less were observed in penicillins, whereas cefepime dropped below acceptable pH limits by day 7. Absorbance shifts of more than 100 units were seen in several antibiotics by day 7.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In the current study, using skim milk agar medium, three bacterial strains (Pro SS14, Pro NTL1, Pro SM) were identified for protease production out of thirty tannery waste samples. The bacterial isolates were identified through morphological, biochemical and molecular basis and the highest protease producer (134 U/mL) having the paramount protein content (8.75%) with the greatest biomass (absorbance 1.7 at 600 nm) was further bioinformatically identified as Bacillus subtilis Pro NTL1. Moreover, the cultural conditions-pH, temperature, incubation period and salinity were tested to get the optimized condition for the three isolates where Bacillus subtilis Pro NTL1 gave best growth at pH 9 demonstrating alkaline protease producing capability, at 45  degrees C for 72 h proving its thermotolerance characteristics and at 3% NaCl concentration declaring its halotolerance property. Furthermore, following Kirby-Bauer agar disc diffusion technique, the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was investigated showing Bacillus subtilis Pro NTL1 was resistant to ampicillin, penicillin, sulfafurazole and sensitive to amoxicillin, gentamycin, cefotaxime, kanamycin, imipenem, tetracycline. Additionally, Bacillus subtilis Pro NTL1 showed antagonistic activity against three pathogens named Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium and Escherichia coli.

Our analysis reveals that cold plasma pre-treatment significantly reduced surface roughness, transforming 200 nm spikes into an almost perfectly uniform surface, while enhancing the substrate's surface energy by lowering the water contact angle from 59 degrees  to 0 degrees , all achieved within just 30 s of 0.9-mW plasma treatment, while 15-min green-laser treatment facilitated more uniform deposition of AuNPs across the entire treated area, effectively creating the SERS substrates. The combined treatments result in enhancement of the Raman intensity (11 times) and consistency over the whole area of the SERS substrates, and their reusability (up to 10 times). The fabricated SERS substrates exhibit a significant enhancement factor of approximately 3 x 10(8) with R6G, allowing detection down to a concentration of 10(-12) M. We demonstrate the application of these SERS substrates by detecting amoxicillin-an antibiotic used worldwide to treat a diversity of bacterial infections-in a dynamic expanded linear range of seven orders (from 10(-3) to 10(-9) M) with high reliability (R(2) = 0.98), and a detection limit of 9 x 10(-10) M. Our approach to high-performance SERS substrate fabrication holds potential for further expansion to other metallic NPs like Ag, or magnetic NPs (Fe(3)O(4)).","[('AuNPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ag', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NPs', 'CHEMICAL')]"

39512463,2024,"BACKGROUND: H. pylori eradication is effective for gastric cancer prevention. Treatment failure is caused by increased antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to determine eradication rates and perform cost analysis between susceptibility-guided therapy and empirical treatment in patients with H. pylori treatment failure. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with dyspepsia undergoing gastroscopy at tertiary care center in Thailand from March 2014 to October 2021. Treatment failure was defined as persistent H. pylori infection after >/=1 regimen completion. Early AST was defined as AST performed shortly after first-line treatment failure. Demographic data, AST results, eradication regimens, and medication costs were collected from database and reviewed. RESULTS: Of 1080 patients with H. pylori infection, 315 had treatment failure (mean age 58.4 years; 44.4 % males). AST of 85 strains demonstrated resistance to levofloxacin (57.6 %), metronidazole (51.8 %), clarithromycin (44.7 %), and amoxicillin (4.7 %). In multivariate analysis, sequential therapy was significantly associated with treatment failure (OR 1.66; 95%CI 1.01-2.74, p = 0.045), whereas vonoprazan-containing therapy was related to treatment success (OR 1.60; 95%CI 1.04-2.48, p = 0.034). Medication nonadherence (OR 37.97; 95%CI 8.97-160.65, p < 0.001) contributed to treatment failure. Susceptibility-guided therapy provided better eradication rate than empirical therapy (97.5% vs. 65.5 %, OR 20.54; 95%CI 4.92-85.81, p < 0.001) in treatment failure group. Twenty-four patients had early AST, while 61 had AST after treatment failures. Most patients with early AST achieved treatment success by second-line eradication. Early AST provided significantly lower total average cost of treatment than group without AST ($368.2 vs. $402.0 per patient, p = 0.034) and AST after treatment failures ($368.2 vs. $752.8 per patient, p < 0.001). Early AST group had the lowest cost of subsequent medication, posttreatment urea breath test, and hospital visits. CONCLUSION: Susceptibility-guided therapy provided significantly higher eradication rate than empirical therapy in patients with treatment failure. Early AST might be a cost-effective strategy for H. pylori eradication after failed therapy and can prevent unnecessary antibiotic use in Thailand.","[('gastric cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('susceptibility-guided', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('dyspepsia', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('H. pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('urea', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE')]"

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB)-based eradication regimens compared with traditional PPI-based regimens for the initial treatment of H. pylori. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis, searching seven electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating initial P-CAB-based H. pylori eradication therapy. The primary outcome was the H. pylori eradication rate. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and patient compliance. We synthesized the effect sizes of the trials using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: A total of 54 RCTs involving 15,320 patients (74.9% male, mean age 30.2 years) were included in this study. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, VPZ-HD-dual, VPZ-triple, and VPZ-quadruple regimens demonstrated significantly higher eradication rates than PPI-triple, PPI-quadruple, and VPZ-dual regimens. Similar trends were observed in the per-protocol (PP) analysis. Subgroup analysis indicated that poor patient compliance significantly reduced eradication rates. Resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole significantly weakened the eradication effects of PPI-triple, TPZ-triple, and VPZ-triple regimens. Additionally, the eradication rates for 7-day regimens were significantly lower than those for 14-day or 10-day regimens, but there was no significant difference between the eradication rates of 10-day and 14-day regimens. Notably, the risk of adverse events with VPZ-HD-dual was significantly lower than with VPZ-quadruple. CONCLUSION: Vonoprazan combined with high-dose amoxicillin dual therapy not only provides satisfactory eradication rates but also exhibits lower adverse event rates and good patient compliance, indicating its potential as a promising regimen for further promotion.","[('PPI-based', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

39503736,2024,"Type I Alexander disease (AxD) presents with paroxysmal neurodegeneration, refractory epilepsy, and encephalopathy in the first years of life and is associated with a poor prognosis. Although there is no treatment, mild symptomatic improvement has been reported in one case of adult Alexander treated with ceftriaxone, given its interaction with the mutant glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) responsible for the disease's pathogenesis. We describe a patient presenting with irritability starting at 2 months of age, initially attributed to gastroesophageal reflux. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed at 3 months of age due to hydrocephalus secondary to aqueduct stenosis detected through an MRI scan, but the irritability persisted. At 5 months, a new brain MRI was performed due to irritability worsening, onset of abnormal ocular movements and seizures. In addition genetic testing was performed. AxD was diagnosed due to the mutation c.716G>A (p.Arg239His) in GFAP. Since irritability had worsened and had not responded to levomepromazine, treatment with amoxicillin (80 mg/kg/day) was attempted to modulate glutamate levels. The patient showed a striking improvement of irritability in 48 h that persisted over the next months. The patient had frequent daily seizures which did not respond to valproate, clonazepam, or phenobarbital. Perampanel, a postsynaptic AMPA receptor antagonist, was added to phenobarbital and he was seizure free for more than 3 months. Drugs modulating glutamate levels in the central nervous system, including beta-lactam antibiotics and perampanel, may have an important role in the symptomatic treatment of AxD and other neurodegenerative diseases where glutamatergic excitotoxicity is a pathogenic determinant. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Alexander disease is a rare and serious condition that affects the brain, often leading to neurodegeneration (brain damage), seizures, and other problems in early childhood. The disease is caused by a mutation in a gene called GFAP. There is no cure, and current treatments mainly focus on relieving symptoms. This article discusses the case of a baby who showed signs of irritability and seizures from a young age. The baby was diagnosed with Alexander disease after brain scans and genetic testing. Despite treatment with various drugs, the baby continued to experience seizures and irritability. The doctors decided to try amoxicillin, a common antibiotic, because of its potential to help control the disease by affecting a brain chemical called glutamate. Surprisingly, the baby's irritability improved within 2 days of starting amoxicillin, and the improvement lasted for several months. However, the seizures persisted until another medication, perampanel, was added. This combination controlled the baby's seizures for over 3 months. Unfortunately, the baby passed away at 13 months due to complications from the disease. However, doctors believe that drugs like amoxicillin and perampanel could be promising treatments for managing symptoms of Alexander disease and other similar brain conditions in the future, especially where excess glutamate plays a role in the damage. This case suggests that these treatments may help control irritability and seizures, offering hope for better management of this challenging disease.","[('paroxysmal neurodegeneration', 'DISEASE'), ('epilepsy', 'DISEASE'), ('encephalopathy', 'DISEASE'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('irritability', 'DISEASE'), ('hydrocephalus', 'DISEASE'), ('aqueduct stenosis', 'DISEASE'), ('irritability', 'DISEASE'), ('irritability', 'DISEASE'), ('abnormal ocular movements', 'DISEASE'), ('seizures', 'DISEASE'), ('irritability', 'DISEASE'), ('levomepromazine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('glutamate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('irritability', 'DISEASE'), ('seizures', 'DISEASE'), ('valproate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clonazepam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('phenobarbital', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Perampanel', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMPA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('phenobarbital', 'CHEMICAL'), ('seizure', 'DISEASE'), ('glutamate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('perampanel', 'CHEMICAL'), ('neurodegenerative diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('excitotoxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('neurodegeneration', 'DISEASE'), ('brain damage', 'DISEASE'), ('seizures', 'DISEASE'), ('irritability', 'DISEASE'), ('seizures', 'DISEASE'), ('Alexander disease', 'DISEASE'), ('seizures', 'DISEASE'), ('irritability', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('glutamate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('irritability', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('seizures', 'DISEASE'), ('perampanel', 'CHEMICAL'), ('seizures', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('perampanel', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Alexander disease', 'DISEASE'), ('glutamate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('irritability', 'DISEASE'), ('seizures', 'DISEASE')]"
39501298,2024,"Sore throat represents one of the main causes of antibiotic overprescription in children. Its management is still a matter of debate, with countries considering streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis a benign and self-limiting condition and others advocating for its antibiotic treatment to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. Italian paediatricians frequently prescribe antibiotics on a clinical basis regardless of microbiological results. Moreover, broad-spectrum antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed for this condition. In this regard, an intersociety consensus conference was issued to promote the judicious use of antibiotic therapy in paediatric outpatient settings. A systematic review of the literature was performed, and updated recommendations were developed according to the GRADE methodology. Antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day) for 10 days is recommended in all children with proven streptococcal pharyngitis. Benzathine-penicillin could be prescribed in children with impaired intestinal absorption or inability to tolerate enteral intake and in those at high risk of suppurative complications with low compliance to oral therapy. In children with suspected amoxicillin allergy, third-generation cefalosporins for five days are recommended in low-risk patients, and macrolides are recommended in high-risk ones.

39501162,2024,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori changes from spiral to coccoid depending on the host state, environmental factors, and surrounding microbial communities. The coccoid form of H. pylori still maintains its complete cellular structure, retains virulence genes, and thus plays a role in pathogenicity. To understand the coccoid form, it is crucial to establish the in vitro generation of the coccoid H. pylori. Although some conditions have been studied for the generation of the coccoid form, few studies have compared these conditions for coccoid generation. Here, we generated coccoid forms via three methods and compared the differences in morphology, viability, culturability, and protein expression. RESULTS: The coccoid H. pylori was generated in vitro via three methods: a starvation method, a method using amoxicillin, and a method using the culture supernatant of Streptococcus mitis. The morphology and viability of the cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy after staining with SYTO9 and propidium iodide. The culturability of H. pylori was examined by counting colony-forming units on chocolate agar plates. In the starvation group, no colonies formed after 7 days, but viable coccoids were continuously observed. In the amoxicillin-treated group, the culturability decreased rapidly after 12 h, and showed a viable but non culturable (VBNC) state after the third day. Most cells treated with S. mitis supernatant changed to coccoid forms after 7 days, but colonies were continuously formed, probably due to living spiral forms. We performed proteomics to analyse the differences in protein profiles between the spiral and coccoid forms and protein profiles among the coccoid forms generated by the three methods. CONCLUSION: Amoxicillin treatment changed H. pylori to VBNC cells faster than starvation. Treatment with the S. mitis supernatant prolonged the culturability of H. pylori, suggesting that the S. mitis supernatant may contain substances that support spiral form maintenance. Proteomic analysis revealed that the expression of proteins differed between the spiral form and coccoid form of H. pylori, and this variation was observed among the coccoid forms produced via three different methods. The proteins in the coccoid forms produced by the three methods differed from each other, but common proteins were also observed among them.","[('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('propidium iodide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('S. mitis', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('S. mitis', 'DISEASE'), ('S. mitis', 'DISEASE')]"

39500715,2024,"BACKGROUND: The continuous increase in drug-resistant strains, the lack of novel antibiotics, and the fewer options available to combat antibiotic-resistant infections in pediatrics pose significant challenges to the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in children. This study evaluated the efficacy of first-line therapy with bismuth quadruple therapy in H. pylori-positive pediatric patients with peptic ulcers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 136 patients (aged between 8 and 17 years) diagnosed with active peptic ulcers with H. pylori infection were enrolled in this study. Patients with H. pylori strain sensitive to tetracycline and metronidazole were assigned to bismuth quadruple therapy, including a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole. Antibiotic resistance of H. pylori was analyzed by the Epsilometer test. Treatment efficacy was evaluated at 12 weeks based on H. pylori eradication and peptic ulcer healing rates. H. pylori infection status was evaluated by a (13)C-urea breath test. RESULTS: Most isolates showed extremely high rates of resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics used for children, including clarithromycin (97.0%) and amoxicillin (84.6%), while the low rate of resistance to levofloxacin (16.2%). The overall success rate of eradication therapy in the intention-to-treat and the per-protocol group were 86.0% and 89.3%, respectively. Peptic ulcer healing rates for total patients at 6 weeks and 12 weeks were 75.0% and 97.7%, respectively. There were no entail unpleasant adverse events, and peptic ulcer symptoms decreased steadily over time in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The bismuth quadruple therapy with a 2-week PPI pretreatment and followed by prolonged PPI was highly successful in eradicating H. pylori infection and healing ulcers in pediatric patients with active peptic ulcer.

This article addresses this issue through the characterization of enterococci collected from a Veterinary Biological Isolation and Containment Unit (BICU). METHODS: A total of 73 isolates, collected from different surfaces of a Veterinary BICU, were identified as Enterococcus through PCR at species level, after which 34 isolates were selected as representatives using (GTG)(5) fingerprinting. These isolates were further characterized phenotypically in terms of antimicrobial resistance through disk diffusion and of virulence factors' expression. RESULTS: The majority of the enterococci isolated presented resistance to erythromycin (79.4%), ampicillin (73.5%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (70.6%), tetracycline (67.6%), ciprofloxacin (58.8%) and levofloxacin (50.0%), and were able to produce hemolysin (88.2%) and biofilm (82.3%). Furthermore, in terms of pathogenicity, three isolates (8.8%) were classified as high threats and two (5.9%) as moderate threats.

39497050,2024,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus salivarius is an opportunistic pathogen, and there have been no reported cases of Streptococcus salivarius pneumonia to date. Pneumomediastinum is usually secondary to tracheal or esophageal injury and is very rare as a complication of pneumonia. We report a case of Streptococcus salivarius pneumonia complicated by pneumomediastinum, aiming to enhance clinicians' awareness of rare pathogens and uncommon complications in pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a 36-year-old male, presented with a persistent cough and sputum production for one week, accompanied by a sore throat that had developed just one day prior. Chest computed tomography (CT) disclosed pneumomediastinum alongside obstructive atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Streptococcus salivarius infection was conclusively identified through bronchoalveolar lavage metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), as well as smear and culture analyses. The patient was administered intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium for a duration of seven days as part of the anti-infection regimen. Given the stability of the patient's respiratory and circulatory systems, a tube drainage procedure was deemed unnecessary. Post-treatment, the patient's clinical symptoms notably improved. A subsequent chest CT scan revealed the re-expansion of the left lower lung and near-complete resolution of pneumomediastinum. CONCLUSION: There are numerous pathogens that can cause pneumonia. While focusing on common pathogens, it is important not to overlook rare ones. When considering infections from rare pathogens, it is recommended to promptly perform a bronchoscopy and submit bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for mNGS to improve pathogen detection rates. During the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia, it is crucial to be vigilant for rare complications.

39496923,2024,"DATA SOURCES: The systematic review utilised multiple electronic databases to gather relevant literature, including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Medline. The search was conducted focusing on clinical studies where Enterococcus strains were isolated to assess their antimicrobial resistance. The search strategy was designed based on the PICO model, targeting patients with secondary/persistent endodontic infections (SPEI) and evaluating the resistance profiles of Enterococci to systemic antibiotics. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 584 studies were initially identified through database searches. After removing duplicates, 517 studies were excluded based on title and abstract screening, leading to the final inclusion of 11 clinical trials that met the eligibility criteria. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Brazil, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Sweden, the United States, and Japan. The focus was on permanent teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis undergoing endodontic retreatment. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers, who compiled details such as authorship, year of publication, country of study, sample groups, bacterial strains tested, antibiotics used, and resistance outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROB-2 platform, and all studies were considered to have a low risk of bias, with occasional minor deficiencies noted. The analysis revealed fluctuating resistance profiles of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) to various antibiotics over time. RESULTS: E. faecalis isolated from teeth with SPEI showed intermediate resistance to 16 antibiotics. The most effective antibiotics identified were the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate, followed by amoxicillin and benzylpenicillin. In patients with penicillin allergies, moxifloxacin and azithromycin were suggested as alternatives, albeit with caution due to their varying resistance levels. The antibiotics demonstrating the highest resistance patterns against E. faecalis included clindamycin, gentamicin, metronidazole, and rifampicin, which are contraindicated in SPEI cases. CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns is crucial for effective endodontic treatment protocols. The emergence of resistance among Enterococci, particularly E. faecalis, necessitates regular susceptibility testing to inform clinical decisions and improve treatment outcomes. The findings underscore the need for health professionals to stay informed about the evolving resistance landscape to ensure safe and effective therapeutic regimens in endodontics.","[('secondary/persistent', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('Enterococci', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('faecium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('faecium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('benzylpenicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergies', 'DISEASE'), ('moxifloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifampicin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39495800,2024,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) using esomeprazole and amoxicillin to furazolidone-based quadruple therapy (FBQT) in treating nonresponsive patients with Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 209 patients with H. pylori infection, who had previously received ineffective treatment and visited an outpatient clinic, were randomly assigned to either the HDDT or FBQT groups. All patients underwent a 14-day treatment regimen, and the success rates of H. pylori eradication and safety of the treatment regimens were assessed 4 weeks posttreatment. RESULTS: Following the 14-day treatment period, the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis revealed eradication rates of 93.6% for HDDT and 86.9% for FBQT. In the per-protocol (PP) analysis, eradication rates were 94.5% for HDDT and 88.7% for FBQT. No significant difference in eradication rates was observed between the two groups. HDDT exhibited significantly lower rates of adverse reactions (9.1% in ITT and 9.2% in PP) compared with FBQT (58.6% in ITT and 59.8% in PP). Multivariate analysis identified interval time, alkaline phosphatase, and serum creatinine level as factors influencing the eradication rate. The area under the receiver operating curve of the interval time between the FBQT group and the HDDT group and the success of H. pylori eradication were 0.622 and 0.578, respectively. The optimal salvage treatment intervals were determined as 6 months for FBQT and 1 year for HDDT. CONCLUSION: HDDT using high-dose esomeprazole and amoxicillin demonstrated efficacy in treating H. pylori infection, with the added benefits of reduced side effects and improved medication compliance compared with FBQT.

39493937,2024,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis is increasing over time. Data on the impact of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of amoxicillin on treatment outcomes are scarce. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of E. faecalis infective endocarditis and to evaluate whether the MIC of amoxicillin might influence mortality. MATERIALS: We retrospectively included all consecutive patients diagnosed with definite E. faecalis infective endocarditis between 2013 and 2020 in 11 French hospitals. We extracted data from the local diagnosis-related group (DRG) database and matched these data with microbiological results. Amoxicillin MIC was determined by Etest strip. The primary endpoints were endocarditis-related mortality and risk factors for endocarditis-related mortality including amoxicillin MIC. RESULTS: A total of 403 patients with definite E. faecalis infective endocarditis were included. Patients were predominantly male (76.4%) with a median age of 74 years (67-82). Embolic complications occurred in 170 (42.1%) patients. Cardiac surgery was performed in 158 (61.5%) patients. The endocarditis-related mortality rate was 28.3% and the median delay between mortality and onset of hospitalization was 24 (9; 41) days. E. faecalis MIC of amoxicillin was available for 246 (61%) patients. The median MIC was 0.5 mg/L (0.4-0.7). Amoxicillin MIC was not found to be associated with in-hospital mortality. None of the variables included in the multivariate model were identified as a risk factor for mortality and there was no correlation between mortality and the duration of treatment for 4 weeks versus 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Higher amoxicillin MIC was not a risk factor leading to endocarditis-related mortality in definite E. faecalis infective endocarditis.

39493122,2024,"Introduction Burkholderia cepacia complex(BCC) is one of the most common polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli isolated in the clinical microbiological laboratory. They are often underreported when conventional biochemicals are used for identification, due to their similarity to other non-fermenting bacilli. It is essential to identify BCC using simple biochemical tests with good reliability to ease the identification of BCC in resource-limited settings and initiate treatment. Objectives We aim to identify isolates belonging to BCC from other non-fermenters using simple conventional biochemical tests, automated methods, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyze antibiotic profiles and treatment outcomes in patients with BCC infection. Materials and methods All samples received at the clinical microbiology laboratory for bacterial culture from March 2023 to March 2024 were included in this study. Samples that grew non-lactose fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar, which were resistant to polymyxin B 300 (PB300) units, were further identified using conventional biochemicals, and lysine decarboxylase test, ornithine decarboxylase test, arginine dihydrolase test, ortho-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside (ONPG) test, urea hydrolysis, triple disc screening test (polymyxin B 300 units, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 20/10 mcg (AMC20/10), and gentamicin 10 mcg (GEN10)), VITEK MS (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France), VITEK 2 Gram-Negative (GN) Identification (ID) Card (bioMerieux), and PCR targeting groEL sequence was performed for Burkholderia isolates. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern was analyzed using VITEK AST (bioMerieux). Basic patient details were collected from the medical records. Results Using conventional biochemicals and automated methods, 60 isolates were identified belonging to the genus Burkholderia, among which 46 (76.6%) belonged to Burkholderia cepacia complex. The concordance for genus-level identification of Burkholderia with conventional biochemicals, VITEK MS, VITEK 2, and groEL PCR was found to be 100%. Species-level identification using the listed conventional biochemicals was 28.2% as compared to VITEK MS.All the isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime (n=46, 100%). Risk factors included diabetes mellitus (n=19, 41.3%) and indwelling devices such as central venous catheters (CVCs), urinary catheters, and mechanical ventilation. Recovery was seen in 40 (86.9%) patients on treatment with recommended antibiotics. Conclusion Our study shows that the identification of the genus Burkholderia by conventional biochemicals was as efficient as automated and molecular methods. Species identification of BCC was better with automated systems. Infections with BCC commonly occurred in patients with diabetes mellitus and indwelling devices. Treatment with recommended antibiotics showed high recovery rates.","[('BCC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('BCC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('BCC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('BCC infection', 'DISEASE'), ('non-lactose', 'DISEASE'), ('polymyxin B', 'CHEMICAL'), ('lysine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ornithine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('arginine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('urea', 'CHEMICAL'), ('polymyxin B', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cepacia', 'DISEASE'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diabetes mellitus', 'DISEASE'), ('BCC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Infections', 'DISEASE'), ('BCC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diabetes mellitus', 'DISEASE')]"
39492823,2024,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication rates have declined with the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains in recent years. Although highly effective with a low prevalence of resistance, standard dose tetracycline is associated with frequent adverse events. The efficacy and safety of low-dose tetracycline as part of tetracycline and amoxicillin-containing bismuth quadruple therapy are not well described. AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of low-dose compared to standard dose tetracycline with combined amoxicillin-containing bismuth quadruple therapy in patients with H. pylori infection. METHODS: Consecutive patients with H. pylori infection receiving tetracycline, amoxicillin, proton pump inhibitor, and bismuth for 14 days at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital (1/2022-6/2023) were evaluated. The low-dose tetracycline group received tetracycline 500 mg twice daily (bid) while the standard dose group received 750 mg bid or 500 mg three times daily (tid). Primary endpoints were H. pylori eradication rate and treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS: The mean age of the 218 patients was 48.7 +/- 14.0 years, 120 (55%) were male, and 118 (54.1%) received treatment as primary therapy. Furthermore, 73 (33%) patients received low-dose tetracycline (500 mg bid) and 145 (67%) received standard dose tetracycline including 500 mg tid in 74 (33%) and 750 mg bid in 71 (33%). On intention-to-treat analysis, H. pylori eradication rates were 89% [95% confidence interval (CI): 82%-96%] in the 500 mg bid group, 82% (95%CI: 74%-91%) in the 500 mg tid group, and 79% (95%CI: 69%-89%) in the 750 mg bid group without a statistically significant difference (P = 0.25). The incidence of adverse events was lower in the low-dose compared to the standard dose group (12.3% vs 31.1% or 23.9%; P = 0.02).

Tests were conducted with varying pharmaceutical concentrations in six soils and three bio-adsorbents. CIP consistently exhibited higher adsorption than AMX, particularly at higher concentrations. In the binary system, AMX's adsorption exceeded the individual system at higher concentrations, implying a synergistic effect. Bio-adsorbents, especially pine bark and oak ash, displayed superior adsorption capacities compared to soils. Some soils exhibited enhanced adsorption and retention of both antibiotics simultaneously, aligning with the cooperative adsorption model. Freundlich's adsorption model described the competitive adsorption systems well.

METHODS: Hospitalized adults with cIAI were randomly assigned to 5 days of IV sulopenem followed by oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid twice daily or 5 days of IV ertapenem followed by oral ciprofloxacin/metronidazole or amoxicillin-clavulanate depending on baseline pathogen susceptibility. The target treatment duration was 7-10 days. The primary (FDA [Food and Drug Administration]-specified) endpoint was clinical response at day 28 (test-of-cure) in the micro-modified intent-to-treat (micro-MITT) population. RESULTS: A total of 674 patients were randomly assigned. The two treatment arms were well balanced. Escherichia coli (395 patients) and Bacteroides fragilis (111 patients) were the most frequently isolated pathogens. Clinical success rates in the micro-MITT population were 81.9% (204/249) for sulopenem-treated patients and 87.9% (233/265) for ertapenem-treated patients. The lower bound of the CI for the treatment difference of the primary endpoint was below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10.0 (treatment difference -6.0%, 95% CI, [-12.2 to 0.2]). In all other analysis populations, the lower limit of the 95% CI was above -10.0. Treatment-emergent adverse events (all, 26.0% [87/335] vs. 23.4% [78/333]; related, 6.0% [20/335] vs. 5.1% [17/333]) were similar for sulopenem and ertapenem, respectively. Most events were mild to moderate in severity. There were more serious adverse events in the sulopenem arm (7.5% [25/335] vs. 3.6% [12/333]), only two of which were considered possibly drug-related. DISCUSSION: Sulopenem IV followed by oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid was not non-inferior to ertapenem followed by oral step-down in treating cIAI in the micro-MITT population. This finding should be interpreted in the context of country regulations, as endpoint timing, primary analysis population and non-inferiority margin may vary regionally.

39490983,2025,"Amoxicillin crystalluria (AC) refers to the precipitation of amoxicillin in the urine as amoxicillin trihydrate crystals. Amoxicillin-induced crystal nephropathy (AICN) refers to the obstruction of kidney tubules by amoxicillin trihydrate crystals, resulting in acute kidney injury. Usually considered rare and not serious, AC and AICN would be more frequent in patients receiving high-dose i.v. amoxicillin (>/=150 mg/kg per day) than previously reported. AC prevalence ranges from 24% to 41%. AICN prevalence remains unclear. AC is generally asymptomatic, but sudden macroscopic hematuria with cloudy urine suggests the diagnosis. AC is diagnosed by detecting amoxicillin trihydrate crystals in urine. AC is a risk factor for acute kidney injury. Diagnosing AICN is more challenging in the absence of noninvasive diagnostic tools. It is suspected in high-dose i.v. amoxicillin-treated patients who develop acute kidney injury and AC, and after excluding other causes of acute kidney injury (mainly sepsis and acute interstitial nephritis). When testing for AC is unavailable, the presence of demonstrated (high blood amoxicillin levels and low urinary pH) or suspected (rapid i.v. amoxicillin administration and hypovolemia) risk factors for AC suggests its diagnosis. AICN management includes discontinuation/reduction of amoxicillin doses and volume resuscitation to improve tubular flow and urine output and decrease amoxicillin supersaturation. Patients generally recover normal kidney function rapidly after stopping amoxicillin, but renal replacement therapy is required in 10%-40% of patients. No deaths have been directly attributed to AICN.

The disease is transmitted from animals to humans predominantly through the consumption of contaminated food and water. However, the lack of information on the status of Campylobacter makes it difficult to quantify the role of camel meat in the dissemination of the pathogen. A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 2022 to August 2023 to investigate the occurrence of Campylobacter and associated risk factors and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Campylobacter species from camels slaughtered at municipal abattoirs in the towns of Harar, Babile, Jigjiga and Dire Dawa in eastern Ethiopia. A total of 324 (146 carcass swabs, 146 camel feces and 32 abattoir environmental swab samples) were collected and analyzed using TaqMan real-time PCR and culture techniques following standard procedures. In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using the disk diffusion method for eight antimicrobial agents according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. The overall prevalence of Campylobacter was 7.7%. Campylobacter was more frequently detected from carcasses and surface contact environmental swabs. We isolated Campylobacter at the genus level from approximately half of the PCR-positive samples, representing 54.2% (13 out of 24) of the total. The isolation levels of C. jejuni and C. coli were also 5.56% and 2.2%, respectively, which varied significantly (p = 0.037) based on sample type and site. The odds of occurrence of C. jejuni in samples collected from abattoir environments was 7.52 times greater than those in carcass and fecal samples. We detected resistance to chloramphenicol (78.6%), followed by amoxicillin (71.4%). However, 93%, 78.6%, and 71.4% of the isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid, respectively. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was detected in 60% of the isolates. Of these MDR isolates, 9 (75%) were C. jejuni and 3 (25%) were C. coli.

Strong evidence was at least two separate, high-quality studies, moderate evidence was at least one high-quality study and weak evidence was at least one satisfactory study. The authors have now summarised the key points. RESULTS: There was strong evidence that antitussives and beta-sympathomimetics were not effective for bronchitis-related cough and that laryngitis should be treated with oral corticosteroids, with adrenaline inhalations added in severe cases. Also, that amoxicillin for 5 days provided sufficient treatment for paediatric community-acquired pneumonia and that children with apparent viral pneumonia could be observed without antimicrobial therapy. There was moderate evidence that corticosteroids or inhaled agents were not effective for bronchiolitis and that administering salbutamol with a holding chamber could relieve symptoms of wheezing bronchitis.

The OAL group received 20 mg Omeprazole capsules twice a day, two 500 mg Amoxicillin capsules twice a day, and Levofloxacin 500 mg capsules twice a day for 14 days. The OAMB group received 20 mg Omeprazole capsules twice a day, two 500 mg Amoxicillin capsules twice a day, Metronidazole 500 mg three times a day, and Bismuth 240 mg twice a day for 14 days. Evaluation for compliance and drug-related adverse effects were assessed at the end of two weeks. H. pylori eradication was evaluated eight weeks after treatment using the C-UBT. RESULTS: A total of 136 patients participated in this study, and their groups were matched based on age and sex. The results of the C-UBT test showed that the eradication rate of H. pylori was 82.2%, 91.3%, and 97.3% for the three-drug OAC, OAMB, and OAL treatment regimens, respectively. Moreover, all the regimens showed high compliance among the patients. Only OAC and OAL showed a significant difference in the H. pylori eradication rate, and no superiority was found between OAMB and OAL or OAC therapies. CONCLUSION: The regime of OAL achieved a satisfactory rate of H. pylori infection eradication with good tolerance in patients with PUD, without any acute side effects.","[('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('PUD', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('PUD', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('dyspepsia', 'DISEASE'), ('peptic ulcer disease', 'DISEASE'), ('PUD', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('OAC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Omeprazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('OAL', 'DISEASE'), ('Omeprazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Omeprazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('OAL', 'DISEASE'), ('OAC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('OAL', 'DISEASE'), ('OAL', 'DISEASE'), ('OAC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('OAL', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('PUD', 'DISEASE')]"
39480071,2024,"Novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to combat pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to standard-of-care antibiotics. Previous studies have shown that targeted stimulation of lung innate immune defenses through intranasal administration of the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist flagellin improves the treatment of pneumonia when combined with antibiotics. To promote translation to the clinic application, this study assessed the direct delivery of flagellin to the airways through nebulization using a vibrating mesh nebulizer in mice. Intranasal delivery achieved approximately 40% lung deposition of the administered flagellin dose, whereas nebulization yielded less than 1%. Despite these differences, nebulized flagellin induced transient activation of lung innate immunity characterized by cytokine/chemokine production and neutrophil infiltration into airways analogous to intranasal administration. Furthermore, inhalation by nebulization resulted in an accelerated resolution of systemic pro-inflammatory responses. Lastly, adjunct therapy combining nebulized flagellin and amoxicillin proved effective against antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. We posit that flagellin aerosol therapy represents a safe and promising approach to address bacterial pneumonia within the context of antimicrobial resistance.","[('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('flagellin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('flagellin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nebulized', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumonia', 'DISEASE')]"
39479190,2024,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication has been reported to affect gut microbiota distribution. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation on the gastrointestinal microbiota during eradication and the efficacy of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. METHODS: One hundred treatment-naive H. pylori-positive patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 14-day bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (esomeprazole, bismuth, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin) combined with the probiotic (Bifidobacterium animalism subsp. lactis BLa80) or placebo. The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) was completed before and after treatment. Stool samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing at weeks 0, 2, and 10. RESULTS: No significant difference in the eradication rate was observed between the two groups. The incidence of adverse events, especially nausea (p = 0.029), was lower in the probiotic group. After treatment, the GSRS score decreased significantly in the probiotic group (p = 0.039). The gut microbiota underwent considerable changes immediately following eradication treatment, predominantly characterized by an increase in Proteobacteria at the expense of commensal Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, but gradually returned to baseline after eight weeks. By week 10, beneficial genera such as Lachnoclostridium, Parasutterella, Hungatella, and Akkermansia were notably enriched in the probiotic group. Additionally, the correlation networks in the probiotic group were closer to their initial levels at week 10 compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Disturbances in the gut microbiota following H. pylori treatment appeared to be temporary, and probiotic supplementation could mitigate antibiotic-induced alterations in the gut microbiota. This study also provided evidence supporting the effectiveness of probiotics in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms.","[('quadruple', 'CHEMICAL'), ('quadruple', 'CHEMICAL'), ('esomeprazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nausea', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('antibiotic-induced alterations', 'DISEASE'), ('gastrointestinal symptoms', 'DISEASE')]"
39477882,2024,"Bacterial peritonitis infections comprise a life-threatening clinical condition in domestic animals that commonly lead to sepsis and high mortality. A set of bacterial pathogens have been identified in septic peritonitis in livestock and companion animals. Nonetheless, most descriptions are restricted to case reports or limited to only one domestic species, and a restrict number of comprehensive studies involving this infection has focused on a great number of domestic animals. Here, we retrospectively investigated selected epidemiological data (with an emphasis in outcome), clinical signs, bacteriological culturing, and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of microorganisms isolated of peritoneal fluid from 160 domestic animals (2009-2023) compatible with septic peritonitis. Bacteria were isolated from 71.9% (115/160) of the peritoneal fluid from 75 dogs (75/115 = 65.2%), 22 cats (22/115 = 19.1%), 14 horses (14/115 = 12.2%), and 4 cattle (4/115 = 3.5%). Among animals with bacterial isolation, Escherichia coli (34/115 = 29.6%), alfa-hemolytic Streptococcus (12/115 = 10.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (8/115 = 6.9%), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (7/115 = 6.1%), and Pasteurella multocida (6/115 = 5.2%) were predominant in pure culture, in addition to a miscellaneous of other bacteria isolated in minor frequency, e.g., Pseudomonas sp., Trueperella pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella sp. In general, in vitro susceptibility tests of isolates revealed that florfenicol, chloramphenicol, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid showed moderate effectivity (>/= 60%). Conversely, most of isolates exhibited resistance mainly to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, enrofloxacin, and penicillin (> 60%). Additionally, multidrug resistance was found in 42.6% (49/115) of the isolates. Data related to the outcome were available in 37.4% (43/115) of animals that had bacterial isolation and, from these, the mortality rate was 79.1% (34/43), with a significant association (p < 0.036) between mortality and septic peritonitis by gram-negative bacteria. Neoplasia (7/43 = 16.3%), pneumonia/pulmonary abscess (5/43 = 11.6%), hepatitis (5/43 = 11.6%), metritis/pyometra (4/43 = 9.3%), and gall bladder rupture (3/43 = 7%) represented the probable main sources of septic peritonitis. Anorexia (34/115 = 29.6%), emesis (29/115 = 25.2%), lethargy (26/115 = 22.6%), respiratory distress (25/115 = 21.7%), ascites (20/115 = 17.4%), and fever (19/115 = 16.5%) were the most frequent clinical signs among animals with bacterial isolation. A variety of bacteria were isolated in the peritoneal fluid of animals, with a predominance of Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, and staphylococci, highlighting the opportunistic nature of the pathogens in septic peritonitis. High in vitro multidrug resistance of isolates and high mortality of animals reinforce the need for early diagnosis and therapy based on the in vitro antimicrobial profile of the pathogens involved in septic peritonitis.

39477340,2024,"OBJECTIVE: To describe antibiotic prescribing practices using the WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification in West African children under 5 years of age attending public primary health centres (PHCs). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The AIRE project implemented the systematic use of pulse oximetry into integrated management of childhood illness consultations in West African countries (Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Niger). We described antibiotic prescriptions for outpatient children at 16 PHCs and for severe cases referred at district hospitals. PATIENTS: Between 14 June 2021 and 19 June 2022, 15 854 outpatients were included: 968 neonates and young infants (0-28 days) and 14 886 children (2-59 months). Among them, 78 (8.1%) neonates and young infants and 385 (2.6%) children were hospitalised. We evaluated 58 hospitalised neonates and young infants and 275 hospitalised children, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of antibiotic prescriptions according to the AWaRe classification recommended by WHO. RESULTS: At the PHC level, proportions of neonates and young infants with >/=1 antibiotic prescription were 83%, 62%, 71% and 59% in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Niger, respectively. A total of 805 antibiotics were prescribed (85% Access and 13% Watch). The proportions of children with >/=1 antibiotic prescription reached 71%, 66%, 63% and 36% in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Niger, respectively. Out of the 9630 antibiotics prescribed, 93% were Access (mainly amoxicillin), and 7% Watch. At the hospital level, Watch antibiotics were mainly prescribed for severe cases referred. No Reserve antibiotics were prescribed. CONCLUSIONS: High proportions of antibiotics were prescribed to outpatient children included, the appropriateness of which needs further study. Nevertheless, in every country, the proportion prescribed in the Access group reached the minimum threshold of 60% of all antibiotic prescriptions, as recommended by WHO.

39475665,2024,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are extremely common, affecting people of all ages and health statuses. Although UTIs do not usually cause severe illness, in some cases they can lead to more serious complications, especially if their initial treatment is ineffective due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR is an increasing issue, exacerbated by misdiagnosis and inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics, thus facilitating further resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the rates of AMR in Escherichia coli isolated from clinical urine specimens tested at the Balfour Hospital, Orkney, and determine trends related to patient risk factors. Antibiotic susceptibilities were tested for 100 isolates of uropathogenic E. coli using the VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux), and data were analysed using percentage resistance rates. Resistance rates were compared by patient sex, age and source (hospital versus community). The findings showed higher AMR in males compared with females, particularly for trimethoprim (TMP), with 52% in males and only 12% in females. AMR tended to be higher in E. coli isolated from hospital inpatients than from community specimens, except for amoxicillin (AMX) and co-amoxiclav. Finally, the study found that AMR of E. coli isolates was greater in patients aged over 50 than 18-50 years old, particularly for AMX and TMP. The highest resistance rates across all patient demographics were for AMX, implying that the use of this antibiotic for the treatment of E. coli UTIs is not appropriate.","[('Urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('illness', 'DISEASE'), ('trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TMP', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-amoxiclav', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('TMP', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE')]"

Neurological examination revealed signs of meningeal irritation, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated white cell count and protein levels consistent with bacterial meningitis. Treatment followed Dutch guidelines with amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and dexamethasone, resulting in rapid clinical improvement. Microbiological confirmation of C. canimorsus followed later. The patient was treated with antibiotics for the duration of 1 week and remained symptom-free after being discharged. CONCLUSION: C. canimorsus meningitis, although rare, poses diagnostic challenges due to its variable presentation and slow growth in culture. Empirical therapy guided by susceptibility testing contributes to favorable outcomes.

39467762,2024,"In order to assess the antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli and its transmission risk in a rice-frog coculture system in Zhejiang Province, this study collected E. coli from isolated soil, field water, and frog feces from the rice-frog coculture systems in four different areas of Zhejiang Province. The collected isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing, while their antibiotic-resistant phenotypes were determined by Kirby-Bauer (K-B) method. PCR was used to identify the antibiotic-resistant genotypes and integrons, while conjugative transfer experiments were used to assess resistance transmission characteristics. The results showed a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the 82 strains of E. coli tested, primarily against tetracycline, sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin, and erythromycin. Most of these strains exhibited multidrug resistance, with the Fuyang area demonstrating the highest resistance rate compared to the other three areas. Further PCR analysis identified the sul1 gene as the most frequently detected resistance gene (63.41%), followed by bla(TEM), tetA, and tetB. Among the 16 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) detected, the Fuyang isolates consistencly exhibited higher detection rate of 9 ARGs in comparison to the other regions. Additionally, the integrase gene intI1 displayed the highest detection rate, with 14 strains (34.15%) of integrase-positive bacteria carrying gene cassettes. Four different gene cassette compositions were observed, with dfrA1-aadA1 and dfrA17-aadA5 being the most common combinations. Conjugative transfer experiments demonstrated successful transfer of gene cassettes in 4 out of 14 donor bacteria, with conjugation transfer frequencies ranging from 4.32x10(-5) to 7.13x10(-4). These findings revealed the severity of resistance in the Fuyang area among the four regions. Integrons play a significant role in mediating the resistance to multiple antibiotics in E. coli, facilitating the potential spread of resistance gene cassettes between different bacteria. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the resistance status and transmission characteristics of E. coli in the rice-frog coculture system in Zhejiang Province, providing a theoretical basis for ensuring the food safety of rice crops.","[('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfisoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39466532,2024,"Due to its widespread use and incomplete breakdown in the human body, amoxicillin has been detected in receiving water bodies. This raises significant concerns, like the promotion of antibiotic resistance, toxicity towards aquatic life, disruption of the natural balance of microbial communities within these water bodies, and the struggle of effectively removal by the traditional wastewater treatment plants. Consequently, exploring new processes to complement the existing methods is crucial. Adsorption, a promising highly efficient, selective, and versatile technique, can effectively remove contaminants, making it useful in various industries such as water treatment, pharmaceuticals, and environmental remediation. Several adsorbents are documented in the literature for drug adsorption; however, their fabrication often involves more complex steps and substances compared to chitosan and alginate, which are natural polymers that are biocompatible, non-toxic, and biodegradable. Their tunable properties and ease of modification enhance their efficacy in environmental remediation. Therefore, the novelty of this article is to understand the interaction of amoxicillin with chitosan and alginate adsorbents easily synthetized using the dripping technique. This approach allows us to explore basic principles that can be applied to more complex systems in future studies. The optimal pH for both beads was found to be 4, with adsorption capacities of 74.2 +/- 0.3 mg g(-1) for alginate and 80.4 +/- 0.2 mg g(-1) for chitosan, using 1 g of adsorbent. Kinetics studies indicated that external diffusion governs adsorption for alginate, while internal diffusion governs adsorption for chitosan.

Classical Whipple's disease, a rare chronic infectious condition affecting multiple systems, is traditionally attributed to T. whipplei infection. The conventional treatment regimen consists of a one-year course of oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) and hydroxychloroquine (600 mg daily), followed by lifelong doxycycline maintenance therapy. However, the literature lacks discussion on short-term antimicrobial treatment for acute T. whipplei infections, such as pulmonary abscesses caused by this pathogen. PRESENTATION: This case report describes a 57-year-old male presenting with a pulmonary abscess. The patient underwent bronchoscopic alveolar lavage and pus cavity irrigation. The collected sample was subjected to pathogen targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) analysis. The tNGS results indicated that T. whipplei was the primary etiological agent responsible for the pulmonary abscess. Treatment with 6 weeks amoxicillin clavulanate led to a favorable clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if clinical characteristics of patients with suspected allergic reactions to penicillin and elevated specific IgE to penicillins, differed from patients without specific IgE, to identify predictors for elevated specific IgE to penicillins. METHODS: Levels of specific IgE to five penicillins (penicillin G, penicillin V, amoxicillin, ampicillin, and penicillin minor determinants) were available for 9,100 patients. Using multiple logistic regression, clinical data from 430 patients in this group who had elevated specific IgE to one or more penicillins were compared to data from 4,094 patients without specific IgE to penicillins, who had undergone DPT with a penicillin. RESULTS: In total 5.2% of patients had elevated specific IgE to one or more penicillins.

39462428,2024,"BACKGROUND: Periodontitis, a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease, offers insights into the broader landscape of chronic inflammatory conditions. The progression and treatment outcomes of periodontitis are closely related to the oral microbiota's composition. Adjunctive systemic Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg, often prescribed thrice daily for 7 days to enhance periodontal therapy's efficacy, have lasting effects on the oral microbiome. However, the precise mechanism through which the oral microbiome influences clinical outcomes in periodontitis patients remains debated. This investigation explores the pivotal role of the oral microbiome's composition in mediating the outcomes of adjunctive systemic antibiotic treatment. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples from 10 periodontally healthy and 163 periodontitis patients from a randomized clinical trial on periodontal therapy were analyzed. Patients received either adjunctive amoxicillin/metronidazole or a placebo after mechanical periodontal treatment. Microbial samples were collected at various intervals up to 26 months post-therapy. Using topic models, we identified microbial communities associated with normobiotic and dysbiotic states, validated with 86 external and 40 internal samples. Logistic regression models evaluated the association between these microbial communities and clinical periodontitis parameters. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) determined the mediating role of oral microbiota in the causal path of antibiotic treatment effects on clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We identified clear distinctions between dysbiotic and normobiotic microbial communities, differentiating healthy from periodontitis subjects. Dysbiotic states consistently associated with below median %Pocket Probing Depth >/= 5 mm (OR = 1.26, 95% CI [1.14-1.42]) and %Bleeding on Probing (OR = 1.09, 95% CI [1.00-1.18]). Factors like microbial response to treatment, smoking, and age were predictors of clinical attachment loss progression, whereas sex and antibiotic treatment were not. Further, we showed that the oral microbial treatment response plays a crucial role in the causal effect of antibiotic treatment on clinical treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The shift towards a normobiotic subgingival microbiome, primarily induced by adjunctive antibiotics, underscores the potential for microbiome-targeted interventions to enhance therapeutic efficacy in chronic inflammatory conditions. This study reaffirms the importance of understanding the oral microbiome's role in periodontal health and paves the way for future research exploring personalized treatment strategies based on individual microbiome profiles.

P. aerogenes was isolated from 40% (8/20) of samples. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed universal resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate (4:1), with 87.5% of isolates also resistant to oxytetracycline, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and enrofloxacin. The colistin resistance gene mcr-2 was detected in 75% of isolates, while class 1 integron (int1) was found in 12.5%. The pax toxin gene cluster was present in 75% of isolates. Toxicity assays using Panagrellus redivivus demonstrated dose-dependent effects of P. aerogenes supernatant containing pax toxins. This study represents the first report of P. aerogenes isolation from sow vaginal discharge in Thailand. The high prevalence of antibiotic resistance, presence of the mcr-2 gene, and toxicity of pax toxin-positive isolates suggest that P. aerogenes may be an underestimated factor in swine reproductive health. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the role of P. aerogenes in sow reproductive disorders and its potential impact on swine production.","[('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oxytetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('enrofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colistin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('P. aerogenes', 'DISEASE'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('swine', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39461739,2024,"BACKGROUND: Bismuth quadruple therapies (BQTs) including bismuth, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics have been shown to be highly effective for treating Helicobacter pylori infection even in areas of high bacterial antibiotic resistance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the time trends of use, effectiveness and safety of BQT in Europe using the European Registry on Helicobacter pylori Management (Hp-EuReg). DESIGN: Patients registered in the Hp-EuReg from 2013 to 2021 who had received BQT were included. The regimens prescribed, the number of eradication attempts, effectiveness, adherence and safety were analysed. The effectiveness was assessed by modified intention to treat (mITT). Time-trend and multivariate analyses were performed to determine variables that predicted treatment success. RESULTS: Of the 49 690 patients included in the Hp-EuReg, 15 582 (31%) had received BQT. BQT use increased from 8.6% of all treatments in 2013 to 39% in 2021. Single-capsule BQT-containing bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline-plus a PPI (single-capsule BQT, ScBQT) was the most frequent treatment mode (43%). Schemes that obtained an effectiveness above 90% were the 10-day ScBQT and 14-day BQT using tetracycline plus metronidazole, or amoxicillin plus either clarithromycin or metronidazole. Only ScBQT achieved above 90% cure rates in all the geographical areas studied. Using the ScBQT scheme, adherence, the use of standard or high-dose PPIs, 14-day prescriptions and the use of BQT as first-line treatment were significantly associated with higher mITT effectiveness. CONCLUSION: The use of BQT increased notably in Europe over the study period. A 10-day ScBQT was the scheme that most consistently achieved optimal effectiveness.

39461297,2024,"Reuse of treated wastewater is necessary to address water shortages in a changing climate. Sustainability of wastewater reuse requires reducing the environmental impacts of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), but it is being questioned as CECs are not regulated in the assessment of effluent water quality for reuse both nationally in Sweden and at the broader European Union level. There is also a lack of details in this topic on which CECs to be addressed and methodologies to be used for assessing their environmental impacts. A better understanding of the ecological risks and health hazards of CECs associated with wastewater reuse will assist in the development of effective regulations on water reuse, (inter)nationally, as well as related treatment/monitoring guidelines. This review provides a list of specific chemical CECs that hinder sustainable wastewater reuse, and also demonstrates a holistic quantitative methodology for assessing, scoring and prioritizing their associated ecological risks and health hazards posed to the environment and humans. To achieve this, we compile information and concentrations of a wide range of CECs ( approximately 15 000 data entries) identified in Swedish effluent wastewater from domestic (blackwater, greywater, mixture of both) and municipal settings, and further perform a meta-analysis of their potentials for 14 risk and hazard features, consisting of ecological risk, environmental hazard, and human health hazard. The features are then scored against defined criteria including guideline values, followed by score ranking for prioritization. This finally produces a unique list of chemical CECs from high to low priority based on risk- and hazard-evaluations. Out of the priority chemicals, 30, mainly pharmaceuticals, had risk quotient >/= 1, indicating ecological risk, 16 had environmental hazard being persistent and mobile, and around 60 resulted in positive predictions for at least four human health hazards (particularly skin sensitization, developmental toxicity, hepatoxicity, and carcinogenicity). The 10 highest-priority chemicals (final score 2.3-3.0 out of 4.0) were venlafaxine, bicalutamide, desvenlafaxine, diclofenac, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, diethyltoluamide, genistein, azithromycin, and fexofenadine. Potential crop exposure to selected chemicals following one year of wastewater reuse for agricultural irrigation was also estimated, resulting in a range of 0.04 ng/kg (fluoxetine) to 1160 ng/kg (carbamazepine). Overall, our work will help focus efforts and costs on the critical chemicals in future (waste)water-related studies, such as, to evaluate removal efficiency of advanced treatment technologies and to study upstream source tracing (polluter-pays principle), and also in supporting policymakers to better regulate CECs for sustainable wastewater reuse in the future.","[('CECs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CECs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CECs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CECs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CECs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CECs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CECs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('hepatoxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('venlafaxine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bicalutamide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('desvenlafaxine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diclofenac', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diethyltoluamide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('genistein', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fexofenadine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoxetine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbamazepine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CECs', 'CHEMICAL')]"

The main points of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli contamination were identified in the two slaughterhouses through three collections. The stages with the highest counts were post-bleeding and evisceration in both slaughterhouses and after manual toileting in slaughterhouse B in the first collection. Most E. coli isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobials, with higher resistance frequencies to amoxicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, and streptomycin. The virulence genes eae, stx1, and stx2 were also detected. Three isolates had all three genes and exhibited resistance to at least six antimicrobial classes (beta-lactams, macrolides, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, amphenicols, and quinolones). E. coli isolates also showed a high frequency of strains with moderate and strong in vitro biofilm-forming capacity. This is the first study to characterize microbial contamination by pig slaughter stage in the Federal District region, demonstrating the critical points for hygienic production.

39458897,2024,"BACKGROUND: The balance between antioxidants and pro-oxidants plays a significant role in the context of oxidative stress, influenced by both physiological and non-physiological factors. OBJECTIVES: In this study, 18 prescribed antibiotics (including doxycycline hydrochloride, tigecycline, rifampicin, tebipenem, cefuroxime, cefixime, potassium clavulanate, colistin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amikacin, nalidixic acid, azithromycin, pipemidic acid trihydrate, pivmecillinam, aztreonam, fosfomycin sodium, and ciprofloxacin) were subjected to simultaneous determination of antioxidant and pro-oxidant potential to assess if pro-oxidant activity is a dominant co-mechanism of antibacterial activity or if any antibiotic exhibits a balanced effect. METHODS: This study presents a recently developed approach for the simultaneous assessment of antioxidant and pro-oxidant potential on a single microplate in situ, applied to prescribed antibiotics. RESULTS: Ten antibiotics from eighteen showed lower antioxidant or pro-oxidant potential, while five exhibited only mild potential with DPPH50 values over 0.5 mM. The pro-oxidant antioxidant balance index (PABI) was also calculated to determine whether antioxidant or pro-oxidant activity was dominant for each antibiotic. Surprisingly, three antibiotics-doxycycline hydrochloride, tigecycline, and rifampicin-showed significant measures of both antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities. Especially notable was tebipenem, a broad-spectrum, orally administered carbapenem, showed a positive PABI index ratio, indicating a dominant antioxidant over pro-oxidant effect.

39458495,2024,"Background/Objectives: The cause of ulcerative colitis (UC) may be related to commensal bacteria in genetically susceptible patients. We previously demonstrated that triple antibiotic combination therapy induces remission in patients with active UC in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Now, we investigate changes in the gut microbiota of patients who responded to the antibiotic combination therapy. Methods: Thirty-one patients with UC given ATM/AFM (amoxicillin, metronidazole, and tetracycline or fosfomycin) therapy for two weeks were enrolled in this study. The clinical conditions of these UC patients were evaluated by the partial Mayo score. The gut microbiota was compared via the metagenomic shot gun analysis of fecal samples. Results: Of the 31 patients, 16 and 8 experienced complete and partial remission, respectively, over three months in response to ATM/AFM therapy, whereas ATM/AFM showed no efficacy in 7 patients. The dysbiosis before treatment in the active stage could be associated with increased populations of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Rickenella, Clostridium, Flavonifractor, Pelagibacter, Bordetella, Massilia, and Piscrickettsia species. Metagenomic analysis revealed dramatic changes in the gut microbiota at an early stage, that is, just two weeks after starting ATM/AFM therapy. After treatment in the responder group, the populations of bifidobacterium and lactobacilli species were significantly increased, while the population of bacteroides decreased. Conclusions: These results suggest that metagenomic analysis demonstrated a marked change in the gut microbiota after antibiotic combination treatment. In the triple antibiotic combination therapy, remission was associated with an increase in bifidobacterium and lactobacilli species.","[('ulcerative colitis', 'DISEASE'), ('UC', 'DISEASE'), ('active UC', 'DISEASE'), ('UC', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fosfomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('UC', 'DISEASE'), ('Clostridium', 'DISEASE'), ('bifidobacterium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacteroides', 'DISEASE')]"

Results: The two most common causative pathogens for IFI were S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, with frequencies of 19.8% and 6.1%, respectively. The calculation of WISCAs revealed a low empirical coverage of amoxicillin (AMX) or clindamycin (CLN) with 21.6% and 27.7%, respectively. The empirical coverage of amoxicillin/clavulanic-acid (AMC), trimethoprim/sulfmethoxazole (SXT), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) was 50.6%, 53.1%, and 55.4%, respectively.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether SeMet mitigated N. cyriacigeorgica-induced inflammatory injury, oxidative damage and apoptosis in bMECs. Cells were cultured with or without being pretreated with 40 microM of SeMet for 12 h, then challenged with N. cyriacigeorgica (multiplicity of infection = 5:1) for 6 h. Although N. cyriacigeorgica was resistant to lincomycin, erythromycin, enrofloxacin, penicillin, amoxicillin, cephalonium, cephalexin, and ceftriaxone, 40 muM SeMet increased cell viability and inhibited lactate dehydrogenase release in infected bMECs. Furthermore, N. cyriacigeorgica significantly induced mRNA production and protein expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 at 6 h. Cell membrane rupture, cristae degeneration and mitochondria swelling were evident with transmission electron microscopy. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activities were down-regulated after 3, 6, or 12 h, whereas malondialdehyde (MDA) and ROS contents were significantly upregulated, with cell damage and apoptosis rapidly evident (the latter increased significantly in a time-dependent manner). In contrast, bMECs pretreated with 40 muM SeMet before infection, SOD, and GSH-px activities were upregulated (p < 0.05); MDA and ROS concentrations were downregulated (p < 0.05), and apoptosis was reduced (p < 0.05).

39452231,2024,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a global health concern, affecting approximately two-thirds of the world's population. Standard first-line treatment regimens often fail, necessitating alternative rescue therapies. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of newer treatment regimens in patients who have failed initial H. pylori eradication therapy. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published after 2010, involving patients with previous H. pylori treatment failure and interventions with vonoprazan-based therapy, high-dose PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy (HDDT), or rifabutin-containing triple therapy. RESULTS: 10 RCTs were included. HDDT demonstrated high eradication rates (81.3% to 89.2%), particularly when combined with metronidazole (92.6%), although at an increased frequency of adverse events. Vonoprazan-based regimens achieved comparable or higher eradication rates (83.3% to 89.5%) compared to PPI-based therapies, with similar adverse events. Rifabutin-containing triple therapy showed high efficacy (80.7% to 100%), particularly in patients with a history of multiple treatment failures, and it was associated with lower adverse events compared to bismuth-containing regimens. CONCLUSIONS: HDDT, vonoprazan-based therapy, and rifabutin-based therapy have proven to be effective and safe rescue regimens for treating H. pylori infection. Additional large-scale randomized studies are needed to determine the optimal doses and durations of these regimens to achieve the highest eradication rate with the lowest incidence of adverse events among patients with refractory H. pylori infections globally.","[('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('PPI-based', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infections', 'DISEASE')]"
39452229,2024,"Background/Objectives: A biocomposite based on magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite and enriched with amoxicillin (MgHApOx) was synthesized using the coprecipitation method and is presented here for the first time. Methods: The stability of MgHAp and MgHApOx suspensions was evaluated by ultrasound measurements. The structure of the synthesized MgHAp and MgHApOx was examined with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The crystalline structure was determined by X-ray diffraction. The FTIR data were collected in the range of 4000-400 cm(-1). The morphology of the nanoparticles was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, the biocompatible properties of MgHAp, MgHApOx and amoxicillin (Ox) suspensions were assessed using human fetal osteoblastic cells (hFOB 1.19 cell line). The antimicrobial properties of the MgHAp, MgHApOx and Ox suspension nanoparticles were assessed using the standard reference microbial strains Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Results: X-ray studies have shown that the biocomposite retains the characteristics of HAp and amoxicillin. The SEM assessment exhibited that the apatite contains particles at nanometric scale with acicular flakes morphology. The XRD and SEM results exhibited crystalline nanoparticles. The average crystallite size calculated from XRD analysis increased from 15.31 nm for MgHAp to 17.79 nm in the case of the MgHApOx sample. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis highlighted the presence of the constituent elements of MgHAp and amoxicillin. Moreover, XPS confirmed the substitution of Ca(2+) ions with Mg(2+) and the presence of amoxicillin constituents in the MgHAp lattice. The results of the in vitro antimicrobial assay demonstrated that MgHAp, MgHApOx and Ox suspensions exhibited good antimicrobial activity against the tested microbial strains. The results showed that the antimicrobial activity of the samples was influenced by the presence of the antibiotic and also by the incubation time. Conclusions: The findings from the biological assays indicate that MgHAp and MgHApOx are promising candidates for the development of new biocompatible and antimicrobial agents for biomedical applications.","[('magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ox', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ox', 'CHEMICAL'), ('HAp', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('XPS', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ox', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39452207,2024,"Recently, the German Federal Institute for Medicines and Medical Products restricted the use of fosfomycin in transrectal biopsy of the prostate (TRBP). Accordingly, the need for other antibiotic agents for prophylaxis in TRBP is urgent since antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory in accordance with these guidelines. After the restriction of the use of ciprofloxacin, and before the use of fosfomycin in Germany was falsely allowed, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was evaluated as an alternative for antibiotic prophylaxis in TRBP. Regarding hospitalization for post-interventional infections, 359 patients at the Department of Urology of the University of Regensburg, at Caritas-St. Josef Medical Center as a single center, underwent TRBP between 2 July 2019 and 30 June 2020. Regarding antibiotic prophylaxis, the post-interventional hospitalization rate due to bacterial complications was relevant. Of the 359 patients, 10 (2.8%) had an infection requiring hospitalization post-TRBP. A total of 349 (97.2%) patients had no infection-related hospitalization. This corresponds to an incidence rate of only 2.8%. Referring to the previous infection rates under the now obsolete ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid can show a similar, if not tendentially even lower, risk of infection, and so this substance can be an alternative for antibiotic prophylaxis in TRBP. Another advantage is that, according to the WHO's AWaRe classification, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is one of the so-called Access antibiotics.

39452194,2024,"Background: Monitoring antimicrobial use is crucial for understanding current prescribing practices. Such information helps in establishing stewardship programs for effectively using antimicrobials and combating resistance to them. Objectives: This study describes how antimicrobials are prescribed at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Pisa and compares how the internal medicine and intensive care units differ in their usage of antimicrobials. Methods: The study involved cats that were presented in the units in 2021 and 2022. Antimicrobial prescriptions were obtained via the hospital's management software (OCIROE). Results: In a population of 1164 non-surgical cats with 397 antimicrobials prescribed, the most prescribed ones were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in the internal medicine unit and ampicillin in the intensive care unit. Twenty-five percent of all antimicrobials were Highest-Priority Critically Important Antimicrobials or Antimicrobial Advice Ad Hoc Expert Group Category B. The oral route was the main route of administration in the internal medicine unit, while parenteral was the most common route used in the intensive care unit. Most antimicrobials were prescribed to treat pathologic conditions affecting the urinary (39%), gastroenteric (21%), respiratory (13%), and integumentary (12%) systems. A diagnosis, accurate dosage, and the use of species-approved medications were recorded in the antimicrobial prescriptions. However, only 11% of these prescriptions were supported by antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Conclusions: These results suggest room for improvement, particularly in increasing the use of antimicrobial susceptibility testing to ensure more targeted antimicrobial therapy. Given the importance of antimicrobial resistance and the One Health approach, the study also highlights the need to consider the broader impact of antimicrobial use in animals, including the potential contribution to resistance in bacteria that affect both animal and human health.","[('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39452192,2024,"Background/Objectives: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a prevalent microbial infection in medical practise, leading to significant patient morbidity and increased treatment costs, particularly in developing countries. This retrospective study, conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, aims to examine the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of uropathogens and evaluate whether these patterns are influenced by demographic factors such as gender, age, or patient status. Methods: Standard microbiological techniques were used to identify uropathogens, and AMR patterns were determined using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Results: Out of 6549 urine samples, 1001 cultures were positive. The infection was more prevalent in females compared to males. The incidence of UTIs in children aged 0-10 years accounted for 12.59% of the total cases, with this age group also exhibiting the highest rate of polymicrobial infections. Among the bacterial uropathogens, 71.19% of isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR) and 84.27% were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Escherichia coli (n = 544, 73.90% MDR) and Klebsiella species (n = 143, 48.95% MDR) were the most common Gram-negative uropathogens, while Enterococcus species (n = 78, 94.87% MDR) was the predominant Gram-positive isolate in this study. Our results indicate that most uropathogens showed resistance against ceftazidime, followed by cefuroxime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and netilmicin. Moderate levels of resistance were observed against ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, aztreonam, and cefpodoxime. Conclusions: Amikacin was observed to be effective against Gram-negative uropathogens, whereas cefixime was more active against Gram-positive microorganisms, such as Enterococcus species. Moreover, a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) depicted no significant influence of gender, patient status, or age on AMR patterns. For the continued usefulness of most antibiotics, periodic analysis of the AMR patterns of uropathogens can help assess the rise of MDR bacteria, and therefore guide the selection of appropriate antibiotic treatment strategies.","[('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('polymicrobial infections', 'DISEASE'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('netilmicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aztreonam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefpodoxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amikacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefixime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('uropathogens', 'DISEASE'), ('MDR', 'DISEASE')]"

39447853,2025,"The presence of antibiotic residues in the aquatic environments poses great potential risks to the aquatic organisms, and even human health. Elucidating the interaction mechanisms between antibiotics and biomacromolecules is crucial for accurately assessing and preventing their potential risks. Therefore, the toxicity of three beta-lactam antibiotics on Escherichia coli (E. coli) was investigated by using the time-dependent toxicity microplate analysis method in this study. Then, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation technologies were used to elucidate the potential molecular interactions between beta-lactam antibiotics and penicillin-binding proteins of E. coli, and their correlation with the physical and chemical behaviors observed in the physiological and biochemical experiments. The results show that three antibiotics exert inhibitory effects on E. coli cells by modifying their membrane permeability, and even more severe cell damage including rupture, wrinkling, adhesion, indentation, elongation and size alterations. But, toxic effect of the three antibiotics on E. coli varies, and toxicity order is followed by meropenem > cefoperazone > amoxicillin. Van der Waals forces play a vital role in the molecular interactions between the three antibiotics penicillin binding protein of E. coli and the sequence of binding free energy is consistent with the observed toxicity order. Shape compensation is the principal determinant for the binding of antibiotics to penicillin binding proteins, which pertains to the drug-induced alteration in the three-dimensional conformation of penicillin binding proteins.","[('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefoperazone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Two organotin(IV) compounds (compounds 1 and 2) were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic and spectrometric studies, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction followed by their impregnation inside the CNTs. The so obtained hybrid materials (1@CNT and 2@CNT) were characterized by FTIR, TGA, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, PXRD and XPS analysis, and assessed for photosensitization and generation of reactive oxygen species. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the fabricated materials in comparison to bare CNTs is attributed to the reduction of band gap and suppression of rapid recombination rates due to the encapsulation of photogenerated electrons. The generation of reactive species in photocatalyst 1@CNT was validated by the degradation of Amoxicillin (AMX) under optimized conditions for catalytic dosage, H(2)O(2) concentration, response time and pH. The material 1@CNT could degrade ca. 83% of AMX by generating free radicals ( OH and  O(2)(-)) under visible light irradiation at pH 6 as investigated by UV-visible spectroscopy and supported by EPR and DFT studies. Furthermore, the structural stability and sustained photocatalytic properties of 1@CNT over four cycles highlight its potential as an eco-friendly solution for degrading environmental toxins.","[('photosensitization', 'DISEASE'), ('carbon nanotubes', 'CHEMICAL'), ('oxygen', 'CHEMICAL'), ('XPS', 'DISEASE'), ('photosensitization', 'DISEASE'), ('oxygen', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL')]"

39438977,2024,"BACKGROUND: The widespread practice of delivering antimicrobials through drinking water to livestock leads to considerable variability in exposure levels among animals, raising concerns regarding disease outbreaks and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. This variability is primarily driven by three pivotal factors: fluctuations in drug concentration within water pipes, variances in drinking behavior among animals, and differences in individual pharmacokinetic parameters. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a strategy that tailors medication delivery based on the drinking patterns of pigs, aiming to improve medication distribution without increasing the overall dose of medication. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that several distribution strategies based on the animals' drinking behavior can effectively increase their overall exposure. These strategies include increasing the exposure of the least exposed animals, raising the average exposure, maximizing the exposure of the majority of the well-exposed animals, or increasing exposure to ensure that a Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) criterion reaches a threshold value for a large number of the animals. In summary, constructing an effective distribution strategy for drinking water requires optimizing a specific criterion. The various criteria and methods for optimizing then are detailed. CONCLUSIONS: As examples, this article demonstrate that incorporating the drinking behavior into the delivery of amoxicillin results in an increase in the percentage of piglets reaching an AUC/MIC ratio greater than 25h. Specifically, with Pasteurella multocida, the percentage rises from 30 % to at least 60 % , while with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, it increases from 20 % to more than 70 % .","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Actinobacillus', 'DISEASE')]"

Microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites, are responsible for enteric infections among children. Excessive and inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs and poor infection control practices have transformed antimicrobial resistance into a serious threat to public health worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the prevalence of enteric pathogens and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacterial pathogens. OBJECTIVE: Assess the prevalence of enteric pathogens associated with diarrhea in children under 5 years at the Bule Hora Health Facility in 2021. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2021 to July 2021 in a Bule Hora Health Centre and Hospital. A total of 422 children with diarrhea were included in the study in the outpatient department. Sociodemographic and associated factors were evaluated using a pre-tested questionnaire. A sufficient amount of stool specimens was collected following standard microbiological procedures. An antigen detection kit was used to diagnose rotaviruses, parasites were examined using microscopy, and bacterial identification was carried out by culture and biochemical tests. The antibiotic susceptibility test of the bacterial isolates was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. The p-value less than 0.05 was declared statistically significant. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of enteropathogens in children under 5 years of age was 17%, with no mixed infections detected. Of this, 7.8% of the children's stool samples contained bacterial pathogens, 5% tested positive for rotavirus, and 4.2% contained intestinal parasites. Unprotected drinking water sources, poor carrier hand washing practices, and poor cleaning of utensils for child feeding were factors significantly associated with the prevalence of enteropathogens. Bacterial isolates have shown a high prevalence of resistance to amoxicillin.

In regions like Korea, where the clarithromycin resistance rate is high, alternative combinations like non-bismuth quadruple therapies have shown favorable results. This study compared the outcomes of sequential eradication therapy with new potassium-competitive acid blocker tegoprazan and conventional esomeprazole-containing sequential therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection were consecutively recruited. Patients were allocated to either an esomeprazole-containing sequential or a tegoprazan-containing sequential therapy group. Sequential therapy comprised esomeprazole (40 mg) or tegoprazan (50 mg) plus amoxicillin (1000 mg) twice daily for the initial 5 days, followed by esomeprazole (40 mg) or tegoprazan (50 mg) with clarithromycin (500 mg) and metronidazole (500 mg) twice daily for the remaining 5 days. Eradication rate, compliance, and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 406 patients with H. pylori infection were enrolled in the trial and analyzed per protocol. Eradication rate by intention-to-treat and per-protocol was 83.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.7-88.9) for esomeprazole-containing sequential therapy, and 87.1% (95% CI: 82.5-91.8) for tegoprazan-containing sequential therapy, with no statistical significance (p = 0.399). Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference in treatment compliance between the two groups. Nausea was more prevalent (23.3%, 27/202) with sequential tegoprazans than with esomeprazole-containing sequential therapy (14.2%, 29/204; p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Tegoprazan-containing 10-day sequential eradication treatment demonstrated similar eradication efficacy compared to esomeprazole-containing treatment, even in regions with high antimicrobial resistance, such as Korea.

39433432,2024,"BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media with discharge (AOMd) results from a tympanic membrane perforation secondary to a middle ear infection. Currently, the impact of AOMd on children and young people (CYP) and their families is not well understood. There is also a need to explore the experience of healthcare professionals in treating AOMd. Interviews with CYP and their parents, and focus groups with medical professionals, were conducted to explore these objectives. METHODS: A total of 26 parents of CYP (age range: 7 months to 15 years) with a history of AOMd (within the last year) and 28 medical professionals were recruited across the UK between August 2023 and March 2024. Healthcare professionals were from primary care (n=17), ear, nose and throat (ENT) (n=7) and emergency medicine (n=4) backgrounds. Thematic analysis was performed independently by three reviewers. RESULTS: The majority of CYP (n=25/26) (96.2%) had suffered from multiple episodes of AOMd. AOMd has a physical, psychological, educational, financial and social impact on CYP and their parents. Parents found accessing healthcare services and information difficult, which increased parental anxiety. Antibiotic overuse was also a concern among parents. The majority of general practitioners and emergency care staff described using oral amoxicillin, compared with ENT doctors who predominantly prescribed topical antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: AOMd has a significant impact on CYP and their parent's daily lives. Need for clear, easily accessible patient information was identified as a priority by the parents of CYP with AOMd. Evidence-based management guidelines should be developed once high-quality evidence is available.

39433023,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Individuals with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are at increased risk of respiratory infection and frequently receive prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotics, leading to antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to identify respiratory pathogens and antibiotic resistance patterns in IEI patients. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 36 IEI patients with positive bacterial growth in sputum cultures between 2014 and 2023. Data covered hospitalizations, respiratory infections, yearly antibiotic prescriptions, past sputum cultures, and antibiotic sensitivities. Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and bronchiectasis served as a control group. RESULTS: A total of 314 sputum cultures were analyzed from patients with IEI, alongside 585 cultures from individuals with PCD and 113 cultures from patients with bronchiectasis. Patients with IEI had a median age of 23.5 years, with 61% male participants. The study compared the differences in bacterial isolates from sputum cultures and antibiotic resistance between patients with IEI and the control groups. The most common bacterial isolates across all groups were Haemophilus influenzae (159 isolates in IEI vs. 314 in PCD and 26 in bronchiectasis), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In IEI patients, 992 symptomatic respiratory exacerbations and 43 pneumonia-related hospitalizations were recorded. Notably, H. influenzae in IEI patients showed high resistance rates to cefuroxime (82%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (66%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (59%), and ampicillin/sulbactam (49%). P. aeruginosa in IEI patients displayed significant resistance to ciprofloxacin (85%), ceftazidime (42%), and aminoglycosides (23-33%). Additionally, all S. pneumoniae isolates in IEI patients were tetracycline resistant, with high resistance rates to penicillin, clindamycin, and erythromycin. It is essential to highlight the substantial resistance of common pathogens to oral antibiotics. In contrast, the control groups exhibited lower resistance rates across all bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern among vulnerable IEI patients. We suggest conducting similar investigations in other regions to address this issue. The findings should inform future infection management guidelines for IEIs.","[('inborn errors of immunity (IEI)', 'DISEASE'), ('respiratory infection', 'DISEASE'), ('respiratory infections', 'DISEASE'), ('primary ciliary dyskinesia', 'DISEASE'), ('PCD', 'DISEASE'), ('bronchiectasis', 'DISEASE'), ('PCD', 'DISEASE'), ('bronchiectasis', 'DISEASE'), ('PCD', 'DISEASE'), ('bronchiectasis', 'DISEASE'), ('aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('respiratory exacerbations', 'DISEASE'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin/sulbactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('P. aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycosides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE')]"

However, there is a paucity of research examining the efficacy of vonoprazan-based bismuth quadruple therapy (VBQT) in the eradication of primary Helicobacter pylori infection. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of VBQT as a first-line treatment for H pylori eradication. This retrospective, real-world, single-arm study included consecutive treatment-naive patients who received VBQT (VPZ 20 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, bismuth potassium citrate 220 mg, all administered twice daily for 14 days) for H pylori eradication between March 1, 2021, and May 30, 2023. The study included both outpatients and inpatients. Eradication rates were assessed using 13C-urea breath tests or 14C-urea breath tests performed 4 to 6 weeks after treatment. The primary outcomes included eradication rates, adverse events, and treatment compliance. A total of 612 H pylori-infected patients were included in the study. The intention-to-treat (ITT), modified ITT (MITT), and per-protocol analyses showed H pylori eradication rates of 84.3% (95% CI: 812% to 87.1%), 95.9% (95% CI: 93.9% to 97.4%), and 96.4% (95% CI: 94.4% to 97.8%), respectively.

39429897,2024,"BACKGROUND: The global threat of multi-drug-resistant bacteria has severely limited the options available for effective antibiotics. This study focuses on the antimicrobial activity and phytochemical characterization of C. oppositifolia extracts, aiming to identify novel plant-based therapeutic agents. METHODS: C. oppositifolia specimens-leaves and inflorescence. Specimens were cleaned, sterilized, dried, and ground into a fine powder. Extracts were obtained using methanol and petroleum ether via a Soxhlet apparatus, followed by fractionation with chloroform, n-butanol, and ethyl acetate. Volatile oil was extracted through hydro distillation using a Clevenger apparatus. Phytochemical analysis was conducted to identify bioactive compounds. Biophysical techniques, including UV-visible spectrophotometry, TLC, HPLC, GC-MS, FTIR, and NMR, were employed for characterization. Antimicrobial activity was tested against S. aureus ATCC25922 and E. coli ATCC25922 using agar well and disc diffusion methods, and synergistic effects were assessed with erythromycin and amoxicillin. RESULTS: Methanol extract exhibited bacteriostatic activity with inhibition zones of 13.0 +/- 0.2 mm for both S. aureus and E. coli. Petroleum ether, chloroform, n-butanol, and ethyl acetate fractions showed varying inhibition zones. Erythromycin demonstrated bactericidal activity, which was enhanced synergistically when combined with methanol extract and volatile oil, increasing inhibition zones against S. aureus. Phytochemical analysis identified phenols, flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins, and glycosides. FTIR analysis revealed functional groups such as amines, aldehydes, nitriles, alkenes, and sulfones. GC-MS identified 24 compounds, with alpha-pinene, caryophyllene, and carene as major components. NMR spectra indicated no complex formation between oils and antibiotics, suggesting the compounds act as synergists. CONCLUSION: The C. oppositifolia extracts possess significant antimicrobial activity and synergistic potential, particularly against S. aureus.

39429841,2024,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global problem and an important consequence of inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents (AMAs). Studies have observed that a lack of awareness of AMR among healthcare professionals as well as consumers results in the irrational use of AMAs, a significant driver of AMR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This educational intervention study was undertaken to assess community awareness regarding AMAs and AMR and to educate them. Ten volunteer students from II MBBS were made aware of AMR, its impact and measures to reduce resistance through a lecture by Pharmacology faculty. Students interacted with 220 family representatives in the community to assess their knowledge about AMAs and AMR using a 15-item pre-validated questionnaire. Charts, videos, and role-play were used to impart knowledge about the rational use of AMAs, AMR, and its consequences. Participants' understanding was ensured with feedback taken on Lickert scale. RESULTS: Students interacted with the study participants and found that most were aware of the term 'antibiotic' (90.8%), but 67% were clueless regarding antibiotic resistance. The purpose of AMA use was not adequately known to 43% as they mentioned using these for diarrhea, viral fever, cough, cold, and sore throat. AMAs were purchased by 40% of participants as OTC medicine, whereas Azithromycin and Amoxicillin were the AMAs they could remember by name. The reasons for buying OTC antibiotics were the inconvenience of doctors' clinic timings, unaffordable consultation charges, and easy antibiotic availability. Students also learned about communication etiquette during this community interaction. This educational intervention proved helpful as the participants agreed that the unnecessary use of AMAs makes them ineffective and AMR is preventable by simple measures. CONCLUSION: A multifactorial approach involving prescribers, regulatory Government authorities and general public is needed to control irrational use of antimicrobials. Timely interventions are necessary to increase the awareness of AMR in the community.","[('AMAs', 'DISEASE'), ('AMAs', 'DISEASE'), ('AMAs', 'DISEASE'), ('AMAs', 'DISEASE'), ('AMAs', 'DISEASE'), ('AMA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('viral fever', 'DISEASE'), ('cough', 'DISEASE'), ('AMAs', 'DISEASE'), ('Azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMAs', 'DISEASE'), ('AMAs', 'DISEASE')]"
39428024,2024,"The widespread use of antibiotics has increased their presence in wastewater, largely due to inadequate removal by conventional treatment methods. This highlights a critical need for effective degradation strategies to mitigate environmental and public health risks. This study reports the photocatalytic degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) using calcium zinc hydroxide dihydrate [CaZn(2)(OH)(6).2H(2)O] (CZ) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by different routes. X-ray diffraction results confirmed the formation of CZ NPs with an 81-95% crystalline phase, while ZnO NPs present a single crystalline phase. The photolysis of AMX under UV-A light (365 nm) was strongly pH-dependent, with degradation rates of 34.7, 5.7, and 4.2% observed at pH 3, 5, and 13, respectively. Maximum adsorption occurred at pH 3, with ZnO achieving 63-83.2% AMX removal and 23.5-47.1% in the case of CZ. The highest overall AMX removal was observed at pH 3, where adsorption dominated the photocatalytic process for both CZ and ZnO. At pH 5 and 13, degradation was primarily driven by photocatalysis in CZ materials, particularly CZ-HT and CZ-SG, while adsorption remained predominant in ZnO. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis indicates benzene ring cleavage in AMX photodegraded by CZ materials. Furthermore, the residues of photodegraded AMX by CZ materials lost antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, the reuse of NPs over four cycles maintained consistent degradation performance, highlighting their potential for repeated applications. The comparative analysis of CZ and ZnO NPs superior photocatalytic efficiency of CZ in degrading AMX. This efficiency, along with its potential for repeated use, establish CZ as a promising material for environmental applications aimed at reducing antibiotic contamination and the associated risks of resistance development.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('calcium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hydroxide dihydrate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('zinc oxide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ZnO', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ZnO NPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ZnO', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('photocatalysis', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39428020,2024,"Sorption by layered double hydroxides (LDH) is gaining substantial interest for remediating emerging contaminants, including pharmaceuticals from wastewaters. Findings from a sorbent material performing successfully in lab-based studies using non-environmental (laboratory-sourced) water cannot be assumed to translate to equal performance under environmental downstream applications. However, studies evaluating sorbent material performance for removal of pollutants and understanding material interactions with environmental waters are limited. This study evaluates the removal of the antibiotic amoxicillin (AMX) using a Mg(2)Al-NO(3)-LDH sorbent material from laboratory-grade water and wastewater effluent (WWE). AMX is successfully removed (94.53 +/- 4.30 % within 24 h) in laboratory-grade water (under batch sorption conditions: 100 mug/L AMX, 0.2 g/L LDH, 20  degrees C). The comparison of LDH removal performance in laboratory grade and WWE shows a decreased maximum removal of AMX in WWE (13.39 +/- 5.53 %). A lower final AMX concentration is observed in the WWE without the presence of LDH, compared to the 'removal' experiments in WWE with the presence of LDH, indicating a contribution of non-sorption removal pathways of AMX. This is proposed to be due to the difference in metal concentrations in the WWE with and without LDH present. The presence of LDH is found to decrease concentrations of metal pollutants in WWE, such as Zn concentration decreasing by 85 % over 24 h, changing water characteristics. Overall, this paper reports that an LDH performs differently in laboratory-sourced water and a wastewater effluent. This provides evidence that sorbent material performance needs to be evaluated in complex water matrices to ensure that it is representative of how a sorbent material will perform in an environmental application, which is the end goal of developing such technologies. Finally, good practice recommendations are provided for future lab-scale sorption experiments evaluating the performance of any new sorbent materials for water treatment applications.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMX', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Zn', 'CHEMICAL')]"

This intersociety consensus aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the antibiotic treatment of mild to moderate CAP in previously healthy children in Italy.A systematic review was conducted to identify the most recent and relevant evidence. Embase, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane databases were systematically screened, with a date restriction from 2012 to April 2024, but without language limitations. The review included studies conducted in high-income countries on antibiotic therapy in children over 3 months of age diagnosed with mild-moderate CAP. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methods. The final recommendations were obtained through a Delphi consensus of an expert panel.Amoxicillin is the first-line treatment if the child is at least immunized against Haemophilus influenzae type b (low/very low quality of evidence, strong recommendations), while amoxicillin-clavulanate or second- or third-generation cephalosporins should be prescribed for those unimmunized or with incomplete immunization coverage for both H. influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae (low/very low quality of evidence, strong recommendations). Macrolides should be considered in addition to amoxicillin in children over 5 years old, if symptoms persist and the clinical condition remains good after 48 h of therapy (low/very low quality of evidence, strong recommendations). The dosage of amoxicillin is 90 mg/kg/day divided in three doses, although two doses could be considered to improve compliance (moderate quality of evidence, weak recommendations).

39420659,2024,"PURPOSE: The evidence of the neuropsychiatric effects associated with fluoroquinolones is mainly supported by case reports. Population-based evidence remains largely limited. We aimed to investigate the association between the use of fluoroquinolones and hospitalization or Accident & Emergency department visits for acute neuropsychiatric events using a self-controlled case series (SCCS) and active comparator to reduce confounding. METHODS: We conducted a SCCS with a recently described active comparator design using all public outpatient clinics, hospitalization, and Accident and Emergency department records from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System, Hong Kong from 2001 to 2013. Among 166 325 people with an oral fluoroquinolone prescription, 4287 people who had an incident neuropsychiatric event were included. We then estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of acute neuropsychiatric events during periods before and after fluoroquinolone prescription, versus baseline. We repeated the analysis for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid users as an active comparator. We then estimated the comparator-adjusted estimates by dividing the IRR for fluoroquinolone by the IRR for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The primary outcome was neuropsychiatric events. Secondary outcomes were psychotic events and cognitive impairment. RESULTS: An increased risk of neuropsychiatric events was observed in the current use of fluoroquinolone [IRR: 2.11 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.58-2.83)] and 1-7 days after the end of fluoroquinolone prescription [IRR: 1.90 (95% CI: 1.30-2.75)] versus baseline. No increased risk was observed in other risk periods versus baseline. Similar patterns were observed in the current use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid [IRR: 1.92 (95% CI: 1.19-3.11)] and 1-7 days after the end of fluoroquinolone prescription [IRR: 1.81 (95% CI: 1.11-2.97)] versus baseline. Similar results were found for secondary outcomes. Using the active comparator design, comparator-adjusted estimates were 1.10 (95% CI: 0.63-1.93) in current use of fluoroquinolones and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.57-1.95) in 1-7 days postexposure to fluoroquinolones versus baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Although our study showed a higher incidence of neuropsychiatric events in the current use of fluoroquinolones and 7 days after the end of fluoroquinolones prescriptions compared with baseline, a similar temporal pattern was also found for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid users. Using amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as the active comparator, we found no difference in the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with fluoroquinolone compared with baseline.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at MTRH diabetes and eye clinics. Participants were selected using systematic random sampling. Sociodemographic data and risk factors were collected through interviewer-administered questionnaires. Blood samples were taken to measure random blood sugar and HbA1c levels. Nasopharyngeal swabs were cultured and tested for antibiotic susceptibility within 24 h. Data analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Associations were assessed using Pearson's chi-square, Fisher's exact test, unpaired t-test, and Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: A total of 124 participants with diabetes and 121 without diabetes were enrolled. Overall, 7.4 % (95 % CI: 4.4, 11.4) of participants carried S. pneumoniae.

39417838,2024,"In Switzerland and other high-income countries, one out of 3000 to 5000 term and late preterm neonates develops early onset sepsis (EOS) associated with a mortality of around 3%, while incidence and mortality of EOS in very preterm infants are substantially higher. Exposure to antibiotics for suspected EOS is disproportionally high compared to the incidence of EOS with consequences for future health and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A safe reduction of unnecessary antibiotic treatment has to be a major goal of new management strategies and guidelines. Antibiotics should be administered immediately in situations with clinical signs of septic shock. Group B streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are the leading pathogens of EOS. Amoxicillin combined with an aminoglycoside remains the first choice for empirical treatment. Serial physical examinations are recommended for all neonates with risk factors for EOS. Neonates without any clinical signs suggestive of EOS should not be treated with antibiotics. In Switzerland, we do not recommend the use of the EOS calculator, a risk stratification tool, due to its unclear impact in a population with an observed antibiotic exposure below 3%. Not all neonates with respiratory distress should be empirically treated with antibiotics. Isolated tachypnea or respiratory distress starting immediately after delivery by elective caesarean section or a clearly assessed alternative explanation than EOS for clinical signs may point towards a low probability of sepsis. On the other hand, unexplained prematurity with risk factors has an inherent higher risk of EOS. Before the start of antibiotic therapy, blood cultures should be drawn with a minimum volume of 1 ml in a single aerobic blood culture bottle. This standard procedure allows antibiotics to be stopped after 24 to 36 h if no pathogen is detected in blood cultures. Current data do not support the use of PCR-based pathogen detection in blood as a standard method. Lumbar puncture is recommended in blood culture-proven EOS, critical illness, or in the presence of neurological symptoms such as seizures or altered consciousness. The accuracy of a single biomarker measurement to distinguish inflammation from infection is low in neonates. Therefore, biomarker guidance is not a standard part of decision-making regarding the start or stop of antibiotic therapy but may be used as part of an algorithm and after appropriate education of health care teams. Every newborn started on antibiotics should be assessed for organ dysfunction with prompt initiation of respiratory and hemodynamic support if needed. An elevated lactate may be a sign of poor perfusion and requires a comprehensive assessment of the clinical condition. Interventions to restore perfusion include fluid boli with crystalloids and catecholamines. Neonates in critical condition should be cared for in a specialized unit. In situations with a low probability of EOS, antibiotics should be stopped as early as possible within the first 24 h after the start of therapy. In cases with microbiologically proven EOS, reassessment and streamlining of antibiotic therapy in neonates is an important step to minimize AMR. CONCLUSION:  This guideline, developed through a critical review of the literature, facilitates a probability-based approach to the management of neonates at risk of early onset sepsis. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Neonatal exposure to antibiotics is disproportionally high compared with the incidence of early onset sepsis with implications for future health and antimicrobial resistance. WHAT IS NEW: * A probability-based approach may facilitate a more balanced management of neonatal sepsis and antibiotic stewardship.","[('sepsis', 'DISEASE'), ('EOS', 'DISEASE'), ('EOS', 'DISEASE'), ('septic shock', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('aminoglycoside', 'CHEMICAL'), ('respiratory distress', 'DISEASE'), ('tachypnea', 'DISEASE'), ('respiratory distress', 'DISEASE'), ('sepsis', 'DISEASE'), ('prematurity', 'DISEASE'), ('seizures', 'DISEASE'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('organ dysfunction', 'DISEASE'), ('initiation of respiratory and hemodynamic support if needed', 'DISEASE'), ('lactate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('catecholamines', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sepsis', 'DISEASE'), ('sepsis', 'DISEASE'), ('sepsis', 'DISEASE')]"
39417037,2024,"Detoxification is one of the most important liver functions. Therefore, liver is the front line of defense when the biosystem faces drug overdose, toxins, and anything that may cause harm. Some famous antibiotics are known for their side effects on liver; one of them is amoxicillin, AM. This work has investigated the toxic effect of amoxicillin on rat's liver with overdose (90 mg/kg) and has studied the ameliorative role of protective and therapeutic Ashwagandha seeds extract (ASE) at doses (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg) against this toxicity. To achieve this work, the authors used two modalities; the first is liver histopathology to figure out the amoxicillin and ASE effects and to detect the sensitivity of another modality; the electric modulus, and its related thermodynamic parameters of liver tissue. Histopathological examination showed that the role of therapeutic ASE in reducing amoxicillin (AM) toxicity was more effective than the protective one. Also, most dielectric and thermodynamic results achieved the same result. Histopathology confirmed the liver injury by amoxicillin and the partial repair by the biosystem using ASE. Moreover, electric modulus, related dielectric parameters, and their thermodynamic state functions showed different changes in their values under the effect of amoxicillin. Using ASE helped the biosystem to restore these changes near their control values.","[('overdose', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('overdose', 'DISEASE'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('liver injury', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

However, the therapeutic effects of NAC on clinical recovery among neonatal calves with respiratory diseases have not yet been studied. Our study represents the first investigation of the effects of NAC in neonatal calves with pneumonia. The objective of this work was to observe the effects of NAC in the treatment of neonatal pneumonia, including its ability to reduce the clinical score, shorten the duration of the treatment, and improve the overall health condition of neonatal calves. For this study, calves were divided into two groups: a treatment group that received NAC and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, and a control group that received amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (antimicrobial only). The findings of this study indicate that NAC treatment significantly shortened the time to resolution (p < 0.001), compared to the results in the group without NAC treatment. Generally, NAC-supplemented therapy reduced the recovery time by more than 27 h (or slightly more than one day), compared to that in the antimicrobial-only group.

The reactions were completed in a shorter time without the generation of any other byproduct. The synthesized N-PHQs were washed thoroughly with distilled water and recrystallized with ethanol to get highly purified products (as crystals). The structure of the synthesized N-PHQs was established by using advanced spectroscopic techniques like FT-IR, NMR ((1)H, (13)C, DEPT, COSY, and HSQC), ESI-MS, and Elemental Analyzer. The N-PHQs derivatives demonstrated moderate to excellent resistance against the tested strains (both fungal as well as bacterial).

39405857,2024,"An accurate yet simple model is the key to the design and control of intricate electro-catalytic oxidation of pharmaceutical contaminated wastewater. For both batch and unsteady-state continuous flow stirred tank reactors (CSTR), batch reactor models have been used earlier. Further, these models do not correlate rate to the operating conditions, and consider pseudo-first/second-order kinetics. Here, first-principles models are proposed by formulating unsteady-state mass balances, modifying them to attain realistic final conditions, and incorporating fractional variable-order kinetics. Following integral analysis, analytical solutions are obtained. These are independently applicable to design, unlike a numerical solution. Nonlinear regression is performed to estimate the model parameters from the transient experimental data. The simulations yield markedly accurate model parameters together with a better fit to the experimental data of Ti/RuO(2)-mediated amoxicillin-trihydrate electro-oxidation, for CSTR and batch reactors. For the batch reactor, the operating conditions are varied one at a time. Their effects on the model parameters are elucidated based on the oxidant and transformation species formed. The computed optimum model parameters are: rate constant 3.318 x 10(-3) mg(-0.092) m(1.276) min(-1), order 1.092, initial rate 4.032 x 10(2) mg m(-2) min(-1), and final conversion 90.6% in 180 min. The corresponding operating conditions are: pH 2.0, feed 50 mg L(-1), electrolyte 2 g L(-1), and current 1 A. A simple generalized power-law correlation, associating rate to the operating conditions, is then estimated. Statistical analysis of these models using central composite design delivers R(2) 0.99, predicted R(2) 0.96, and optimum set close to the above. The corresponding sensitivity analysis and generalized correlation, both show applied current to be the most significant operating condition.

39402648,2024,"BACKGROUND: Approximately, 10% of people report a penicillin allergy; however, more than 90% can safely undergo delabeling after a detailed history, oral challenge, or other investigations such as penicillin skin testing (PST). Although PST is the gold standard, the results can be heterogeneous, and awaiting specialist assessment may take an inordinate amount of time. Therefore, oral provocation challenge has become acceptable for individuals with low-risk penicillin allergy histories. There also appears to be an association with increased prevalence of adverse drug reaction reporting in female individuals, which may translate to penicillin allergy prevalence; however, the evidence has not been assessed through a sex and gender lens. This systematic review will identify and synthesize the findings from studies that report measures of effectiveness and safety of interventions aimed at delabeling penicillin allergies in low-risk individuals. Information related to sex and gender will be extracted, where available, to understand potential differences in allergy reporting and patient outcomes. METHODS: The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Centre for Review and Dissemination's Guidance for Undertaking Reviews in Health Care will be used as frameworks for conducting this systematic review. The literature search will be conducted by a medical librarian (B. M. M.) and will consist of a search strategy to identify and retrieve published studies that meet our inclusion criteria. Studies that require penicillin skin testing (PST) as a step prior to other interventions will be excluded. Integrated knowledge translation involving co-design was carried out for this systematic review protocol creation. Data extraction will be conducted at four levels: (1) study level, (2) patient level, (3) intervention level, and (4) outcome level. A narrative descriptive synthesis of results and risk of bias of all included studies will be provided, and, if relevant, a meta-analysis will be performed. DISCUSSION: The dissemination of findings from this knowledge synthesis to various stakeholders is intended to inform on options for evidence-based interventions to aid in delabeling penicillin allergies in individuals with a low risk of experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction. Detailed reporting on the characteristics of delabeling interventions as well as the effectiveness of similar interventions will benefit policy makers considering the implementation of a penicillin allergy delabeling protocol. Additionally, findings from this systematic review will report on the current evidence regarding the role of sex and gender in both the prevalence and outcomes associated with the presence of penicillin allergies.

39402638,2024,"BACKGROUND: The Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification of antibiotics was a useful tool to support antibiotic stewardship. However, the AWaRe patterns of antibiotic consumption in Western China were unclear. We aimed to assess the antibiotic consumption patterns using the AWaRe Classification of public hospitals in Sichuan Province Western China. METHODS: Antibiotic consumption data of year 2020 were obtained from the Sichuan Province Drug Use Monitoring Platform. We measured the antibiotic consumption (DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day, DIDs), calculated the proportion of antibiotic use, the ratio of Access to Watch antibiotics and patterns of antibiotic use by using drug utilization 90%. RESULTS: This analysis included 4452 public health institutions. The antibiotic consumption rate was 10.39 DIDs (Median 8.50, IQR 7.71-12.96). The proportions of Access antibiotic use and Watch antibiotic use were 46.83% (Median 47.49, IQR 44.16-52.02) and 51.20% (Median 51.43, IQR 45.42-54.61), respectively. The Access-to-Watch index was 0.91 (Median 0.92, IQR 0.81-1.15). Amoxicillin (16.85%), cefuroxime (9.21%), cefixime (8.60%%), levofloxacin (8.11%) and metronidazole (6.16%) were the most consumed antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of Access antibiotic consumption in Sichuan Western China has not achieved the WHO target of 60%. Overuse of antibiotic is serious in Sichuan. National and regional antibiotics management systems, stewardship programs and surveillance of antibiotic consumption based on AWaRe classification are needed to improve antibiotic consumption patterns, curb antibiotic overuse and combat antimicrobial resistance in Western China.","[('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefixime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39402571,2024,"BACKGROUND: The world society is still suffering greatly from waterborne infections, with developing countries bearing most of the morbidity and death burden, especially concerning young children. Moreover, microbial resistance is one of the most prevalent global problems that extends the need for self-medication and the healing period, or it may be linked to treatment failure that results in further hospitalization, higher healthcare expenses, and higher mortality rates. Thus, innovative synthesis of new antimicrobial materials is required to preserve the environment and enhance human health. RESULTS: The present study highlighted a simple and cost-effective approach to biosynthesize a chitosan/graphene oxide/zinc oxide nanocomposite (CS/GO/ZnO) alone and immobilized in a macroporous cryogel as a new antimicrobial agent. Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 was used as a safe and efficient bio-nano-factory during biosynthesis. The formation of CS/GO/ZnO was confirmed and characterized using different analyses including ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), selective area diffraction pattern (SADP), Zeta analyses, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GO combined with ZnO NPs successfully and displayed an adsorption peak at 358 nm. The XRD results showed the crystalline composition of the loaded ZnO NPs on GO sheets. FTIR spectrum confirmed the presence of proteins during the synthesis which act as stabilizing and capping agents. The nanocomposite has a high negative surface charge (-32.8 +/- 5.7 mV) which increases its stability. SEM and TEM showing the size of biosynthesized ZnO-NPs was in the range of 40-50 nm. The CS/GO/ZnO alone or immobilized in cryogel revealed good antimicrobial activities against B. cereus ATCC 14,579, Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922, and Candida albicans ATCC 10,231 in a dose-dependent manner. The CS/GO/ZnO cryogel revealed higher antimicrobial activity than GO/ZnO nanocomposite and standard antibiotics (amoxicillin and miconazole) with inhibition zones averages of 24.33 +/- 0.12, 15.67 +/- 0.03, and 17.5 +/- 0.49 mm, respectively. The MIC values of the prepared nanocomposite against B. cereus, E. coli, and C. albicans were 80, 80, and 90 microg/ml compared to standard drugs (90, 120 and 150 microg/ml, respectively). According to the TEM ultrastructure studies of nanocomposite-treated microbes, treated cells had severe deformities and morphological alterations compared to the untreated cells including cell wall distortion, the separation between the cell wall and plasma membrane, vacuoles formation moreover complete cell lyses were also noted. In the cytotoxicity test of CS/GO/ZnO alone and its cryogel, there was a significant reduction (p<0.05) in cell viability of WI-38 normal lung cell line after the concentration of 209 and 164 microg/ml, respectively. It showed the low toxic effect of the nanocomposite and its cryogel on the WI-38 line which implies its safety. In addition, water treatment with the CS/GO/ZnO cryogel decreased turbidity (0.58 NTU), total coliform (2 CFU/100 ml), fecal coliform (1 CFU/100 ml), fecal Streptococcus (2 CFU/100 ml), and heterotrophic plate counts (53 CFU/1 ml) not only in comparison with the chlorine-treated samples (1.69 NTU, 4 CFU/100 ml, 6 CFU/100 ml, 57 CFU/100 ml, and 140 CFU/1 ml, respectively) but also with the raw water samples (6.9 NTU, 10800 CFU/100 ml, 660 CFU/100 ml, 800 CFU/100 ml, and 4400 CFU/1 ml, respectively). Moreover, cryogel significantly decreased the concentration of different heavy metals, especially cobalt compared to chlorine (0.004 ppm, 0.002 ppm, and 0.001 ppm for raw water, chlorine-treated, and cryogel-treated groups, respectively) which helped in the reduction of their toxic effects. CONCLUSION: This study provides an effective, promising, safe, and alternative nanocomposite to treat different human and animal pathogenic microbes that might be used in different environmental, industrial, and medical applications.","[('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('death', 'DISEASE'), ('oxide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633', 'DISEASE'), ('CS/GO/ZnO', 'DISEASE'), ('ZnO NPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ZnO NPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ZnO-NPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CS/GO/ZnO', 'DISEASE'), ('cereus', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('miconazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cereus', 'DISEASE'), ('deformities', 'DISEASE'), ('CS/GO/ZnO', 'DISEASE'), ('cobalt', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chlorine', 'CHEMICAL')]"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of prescriptions with antibiotics, percentage of prescribers using guidelines for antibiotic prescriptions, and percentage using culture and sensitivity to inform antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS: Of the 1715 prescriptions assessed, 75% (1294/1715) were from inpatients, and 45% (772/1715) included an antibiotic. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole constituted 54% of antibiotic prescriptions from general surgery. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone constituted 64.7% of antibiotic prescriptions from neurosurgery, and ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin made up 37.7% of antibiotic prescriptions from urology.

39393909,2025,"INTRODUCTION: Fluoroquinolones can cause severe collagen-associated adverse effects, potentially impacting the pulmonary connective tissue. We investigated the association between fluoroquinolones and spontaneous pneumothorax. METHODS: A case-time-control study was performed using the nationwide French reimbursement healthcare system database (SNDS). Cases were adults >/=18 years admitted for spontaneous pneumothorax between 2017 and 2022. For each case, fluoroquinolone use was compared between the risk period immediately preceding the admission date (days -30 to -1), and three earlier reference periods (days -180 to -151, -150 to -121, -120 to -91), adjusting for time-varying confounders. OR estimates were corrected for potential exposure-trend bias using a reference group without the event (matched on age, sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease history, calendar time). Amoxicillin use was studied similarly to control for indication bias. RESULTS: Of the 246 pneumothorax cases exposed to fluoroquinolones (63.8% men; mean age, 43.0+/-18.4 years), 63 were exposed in the 30-day risk period preceding pneumothorax and 128 in the reference periods. Of the 3316 amoxicillin cases (72.9% men; mean age, 39.4+/-17.6 years), 1210 were exposed in the 30-day risk period and 1603 in the reference ones. OR adjusted for exposure-trend and covariates was 1.59 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.22) for fluoroquinolones and 2.25 (2.07 to 2.45) for amoxicillin. CONCLUSION: An increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax was associated with both fluoroquinolone and amoxicillin use, with an even higher association for amoxicillin. This strongly suggests the role of the underlying infections rather than a causal effect of the individual antibiotics and can be considered reassuring regarding a potential lung connective toxicity of fluoroquinolones.","[('Fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumothorax', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumothorax', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumothorax', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumothorax', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pneumothorax', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('fluoroquinolones', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39391608,2024,"Inflammatory periodontal diseases associated with the accumulation of dental biofilm, such as gingivitis and periodontitis, are very common and pose clinical problems for clinicians and patients. Gingivitis is a mild form of gum disease and when treated quickly and properly is completely reversible. Periodontitis is an advanced and irreversible disease of the periodontium with periods of exacerbations, progressions and remission. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that damages the tissues supporting the tooth in its socket, i.e., the gums, periodontal ligaments, root cementum and bone. Periodontal inflammation is most commonly triggered by bacteria present in excessive accumulations of dental plaque (biofilm) on tooth surfaces. This disease is driven by disproportionate host inflammatory immune responses induced by imbalance in the composition of oral bacteria and changes in their metabolic activities. This microbial dysbiosis favors the establishment of inflammatory conditions and ultimately results in the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. Apart microbial shift and host inflammatory response, environmental factors and genetics are also important in etiology In addition to oral tissues destruction, periodontal diseases can also result in significant systemic complications. Conventional methods of periodontal disease treatment (improving oral hygiene, dental biofilm control, mechanical plaque removal, using local or systemic antimicrobial agents) are not fully effective. All this prompts the search for new methods of therapy. Advanced periodontitis with multiple abscesses is often treated with antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, clindamycin, or combined therapy of amoxicillin with metronidazole. However, due to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, treatment does not always achieve the desired therapeutic effect. This review summarizes pathogenesis, current approaches in treatment, limitations of therapy and the current state of research on the possibility of application of bacteriophages and predatory bacteria to combat bacteria responsible for periodontitis. We present the current landscape of potential applications for alternative therapies for periodontitis based on phages and bacteria, and highlight the gaps in existing knowledge that need to be addressed before clinical trials utilizing these therapeutic strategies can be seriously considered.","[('gingivitis', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('Gingivitis', 'DISEASE'), ('exacerbations', 'DISEASE'), ('Periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('damages', 'DISEASE'), ('tooth', 'DISEASE'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontal diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontal disease', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('minocycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE')]"

Alectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as first-line treatment targeting ALK-positive tumors. We herein report two cases of appendicitis highlighting it as a rare, possible adverse event of treatment with alectinib. CASE PRESENTATION: The first case is a 60-year-old woman with a previous history of stage 1 lobular breast cancer and early-stage lung cancer treated with segmentectomy, subsequently presenting with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. Treatment with alectinib resulted in partial response, but she developed gastrointestinal symptoms that were assessed with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealing right lower quadrant stranding without appendiceal visualization. Her symptoms continued despite an antibiotic course with re-imaging concerning for acute appendicitis, which was successfully treated with appendectomy and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The second case is a previously healthy 58-year-old man with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who was started on first-line treatment with alectinib and subsequently diagnosed with asymptomatic acute appendicitis on re-staging CT abdomen. Signs on CT resolved with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Definitive treatment was conducted with a delayed elective appendectomy. Both patients remained on alectinib over the courses of appendicitis without interruption.

39391132,2024,"INTRODUCTION: The imbalance between remineralization and demineralization leads to the formation of secondary caries. Fluoride-releasing ability has been the characteristic property of glass ionomer cement (GIC), but it is uncertain if this property alone will be sufficient for the cessation of the growth of the organisms. Therefore, a restorative material with additional bacteriostatic properties needs to be introduced. AIM: To evaluate the microhardness and solubility of the conventional GIC after adding different combinations of antibiotic powders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the three groups were conventional GIC (group I), GIC + metronidazole + ciprofloxacin (group II), and GIC + metronidazole + amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (group III). The concentration of the double antibiotic combination was maintained at 1.5% w/w. The antibiotic powders were added to the GIC and evaluated for microhardness and solubility of the specimens. RESULTS: The mean microhardness level of group II was the highest, which was statistically significant using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a p-value of 0.022. The comparison of each group's solubility in different solutions was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Along with the conventional properties of GIC, an additional therapeutic gain can also be obtained by incorporating various combinations of antibiotics, thereby arresting the progression of caries at the site of infection itself. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This new approach shall help in community health programs, where treatment of a large population needs to be done within a short span of time and arrest the progression of caries activity in deep caries.

Outcomes included total ED presentations for diverticulitis, admission rates, CTs performed, outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, and antibiotics administered in the ED for admitted patients. RESULTS: There were 186,138,130 total ED encounters, with diverticulitis representing 927,326 (0.50 %). The rate of diverticulitis diagnosis increased from 0.40 % to 0.56 % over time. The admission rate declined over time from 33.6 % to 27.7 %, while the CT rate rose from 83.0 % to 92.6 %. Among those discharged, 90.4 % received an antibiotic, which remained consistent over time. Metronidazole (55.1 %) and ciprofloxacin (40.8 %) were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics, followed by amoxicillin-clavulanate (36.1 %). Among those admitted, most received either metronidazole (62.0 %), a fluoroquinolone (40.4 %), a third-generation cephalosporin (18.9 %), or a penicillin-based agent (38.1 %). Among both discharged and admitted patients, there was a marked shift to penicillin-based agents as the primary antibiotic regimen. CONCLUSION: Diverticulitis remains a common ED presentation, with a gradually rising incidence over time. Admission rates have decreased, while CT imaging has become more common. Most patients receive antibiotics, though the specific antibiotic has shifted in favor of penicillin-based agents. These findings can provide key benchmarking data and inform future initiatives to guide imaging and antibiotic use.","[('Diverticulitis', 'DISEASE'), ('diverticulitis', 'DISEASE'), ('acute diverticulitis', 'DISEASE'), ('diverticulitis', 'DISEASE'), ('diverticulitis', 'DISEASE'), ('diverticulitis', 'DISEASE'), ('Metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fluoroquinolone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39386376,2024,"BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are on the rise and are a global concern as they complicate the recovery of patients postoperatively. Bacterial colonization of the patient's skin and alimentary tract are known to be major contributing sources to SSIs. However, Zambia lacks data relating to carriage rates of antibiotic-resistant rectal Escherichia coli among surgical patients. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study aimed at determining the preoperative (preop) and postoperative (postop) carriage and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of rectal ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL-Ec) in elective surgery patients at the highest tertiary hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Phenotypic methods were used in the identification of E. coli. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns and identification of ESBL-Ec was determined by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion. RESULTS: A total of 120 study participants were recruited, of which 75 were followed up at least 72 h after surgery. From 195 rectal swabs cultured, 177 (90.8%) were positive for E. coli, of which 53 (29.9%) were ESBL-Ec, with a significantly (P < 0.0001) higher proportion in postop (47.9%) than preop (17.3%) participants. Overall, ESBL-Ec isolates showed higher resistance in postop than preop to cefotaxime (100% versus 88.9%, respectively), ampicillin (100% versus 94.4%), ciprofloxacin (88.3% versus 83.3%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (80% versus 66.7%) and cefepime (80% versus 77.8%). MDR ESBL-Ec strains were more frequent in postop than in preop participants (91.4% versus 88.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a significantly higher rate of antimicrobial-resistant rectal E. coli in postop than preop participants. There is a need to ascertain the source of the resistance and to institute robust infection control measures, preop screening of surgical patients for ESBL-Ec, and to raise awareness on prudent use of antibiotics.","[('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefepime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infection', 'DISEASE')]"
39385487,2024,"BACKGROUND: Febrile urinary tract infections in children are typically treated with a standard 10-day course of antibiotics. However, prolonged antibiotic use can lead to increased bacterial resistance, underscoring the need to explore shorter treatment regimens. This study aimed to compare the short-term therapeutic effects of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone sodium in children under five years old with febrile urinary tract infections. METHODS: Clinical data from 109 children under five years old diagnosed with febrile urinary tract infections between August 2022 and December 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 52 children received ceftriaxone sodium (group A), and 48 children received amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (group B). Clinical symptoms, laboratory indicators, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Children from group B showed significantly shorter improvement times for fever, dysuria, and urinary frequency compared to those in group A (p < 0.05). Initially, there were no significant differences in the levels of white blood cell counts, squamous epithelial cells, bacteria, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, after treatment, group B exhibited significantly lower levels of white blood cell counts, squamous epithelial cells, bacteria, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin compared to group A (p < 0.05). Moreover, the total effective rate was significantly higher in group B (95.83%) than in group A (80.77%) (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between groups B (10.42%) and A (13.45%) (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid demonstrated superior short-term therapeutic efficacy for febrile urinary tract infections in children under five years old compared to ceftriaxone sodium.

39385331,2024,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) therapy for the eradication of H. pylori in patients from a national pediatric registry of H. pylori infection. METHODS: The Spanish Registry of Children with H. pylori Infection (RENIHp) is a national, multi-center, prospective, non-interventional registry that includes children aged 5-18 years with H. pylori infection diagnosed by endoscopy. All patients in the registry who were treated with CBS between the period 2020 and 2023 were included in this study. The primary outcome was the eradication rate, which was assessed using a (13)C-urea breath test or monoclonal antigen in the stool 6-8 weeks post-treatment. RESULTS: The registry included 682 patients, 38 (5.6%) of whom underwent treatment with CBS. Fifty percent (19/38) of patients had previously undergone unsuccessful eradication treatment. In 78.9% (30/38) of patients, treatment was guided by an antibiotic sensitivity test. In the remaining patients, an empirical approach was employed. The CBS therapies used were as follows: quadruple therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), CBS, amoxicillin, and metronidazole (MET) [18/38 (47.3%)]; quadruple therapy with PPIs, CBS, tetracycline, and MET [13/38 (34.2%)]; and other therapies [7/38 (18.4%)]. Thirty-two patients (84.2%) treated with CBS were followed-up with eradication monitoring. The overall eradication rate in patients treated with CBS was 93.8% (30/32, [95% CI: 85.4%-100%]), whereas it was 86.7% in patients in the registry who were not on CBS treatment (430/496, [95% CI: 83.3%-89.5%], p = 0.208). In the six patients with dual resistance to clarithromycin (CLA) and MET who were treated with quadruple therapy with CBS, the eradication rate was 100% (n = 6/6, [95% CI: 61.0%-100%]).

39385062,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogenic E. coli is a global public health issue, especially in sub-Saharan African countries such as Cameroon. It contributes to increase significantly hospital length of stay, morbidity, mortality and economic costs because of treatment failures. This study aims at determining the resistance background and virulence profiles of ESBL-E. coli isolates among childhood diarrhoea during the cholera outbreak occuring in Yaounde, Cameroon. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a four-month periods, from March 1st to June 30th, 2023,  a total of 84 stool samples were collected from 90 under five children presenting clinical signs of gastroenteritis and attending four hospitals in Yaounde, Cameroon. Bacterial identification was done using API20E and antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. After extraction, genomic DNA was subjected to conventional and multiplex polymerase chain reaction methods (PCRs) for detection of resistance and virulence genes. Statistical analysis was performed using Epi info (7.2.5.0). Statistical significance was considered at a p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 150 patients contacted, 90 patients were enrolled, 84 samples were collected, 52.38%(44/84) and 3.57%(03/84) were confirmed as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing E. coli respectively. The risk factors were analyzed, and children who drank natural fruit juice (OR: 0.4, p-value: 0.03) were found to be significantly associated with ESBL-producing E. coli. The ESBL-producing E. coli isolates showed a high level of resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, colistin, and tetracycline. The bla(CTX-M) was more prevalent ss-lactamase resistance gene. The tetracycline resistance genes tet(A) and tet(B) were also detected. The most important virulence genes detected were FimH (81.81%) and papA (79.54%). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest implementing routine surveillance and screening for antimicrobial resistance among children under five. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies (ASP) need to be implemented to curb the emergence and dissemination of ESBL-producing E. coli. In addition, a national surveillance program for antimicrobial resistance needs to be implemented at local and regional levels in order to reduce morbidity in Cameroon.","[('diarrhoea', 'DISEASE'), ('gastroenteritis', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefepime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('colistin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ASP', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39384950,2024,"Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immediate hypersensitivity reactions are the most concerning adverse events after penicillin antibiotics (PENs) administration because of their rapid progression and potential for fatal outcome. However, the diagnosis of allergic death is a forensic challenge because it mainly depends on nonspecific characteristic morphological changes, as well as exclusion and circumstantial evidence. In this study, an untargeted metabolomics approach based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to screen potential forensic biomarkers of fatal anaphylactic shock induced by four PENs (benzylpenicillin (BP), amoxicillin (AMX), oxacillin (OXA), and mezlocillin (MEZ)), and analyzed the metabolites, metabolic pathway and the mechanism which were closely related to the allergic reactions. The metabolomics results discovered that a total of 24 different metabolites in all four anaphylactic death (AD) groups, seven of which were common metabolites. A biomarker model consisting of six common metabolites (linoleic acid, prostaglandin D2, lysophosphatidylcholine (18:0), N-acetylhistamine, citric acid and indolelactic acid) AUC value of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.978.

39384906,2024,"DESIGN: A retrospective cohort design was used to assess the long-term clinical effectiveness of systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole, used adjunctively with non-surgical peri-implantitis treatment (NST) and whether it prevents the need for further surgical interventions. COHORT SELECTION: Of the 57 peri-implantitis patients examined, 45 patients were included in this study. The participants were divided into two subgroups in accordance to who had received NST with or without systemic antibiotics. Selection was based on prior participation in a three-month randomised control trial, ensuring comparability of data regarding peri-implantitis severity and treatment history. DATA ANALYSIS: Data were extracted pre-treatment, 3-months post-treatment and at a long-term follow-up interval of 36 months. The primary outcome was the need for additional surgical intervention and was analysed via Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression. A multitude of secondary clinical outcomes were evaluated using parametric and non-parametric tests, including peri- implant probing depth, bleeding scores and treatment success. RESULTS: Overall, 62.2% of the 45 NST patients did not need surgical peri-implantitis treatment: 73.9% of the subgroup with antibiotics and 50% of the subgroup without antibiotics respectively. However, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (log-rank test, p = 0.110). The Cox regression analysis also displayed no significance over the first three years post-treatment (p = 0.115). Additionally, the study found that deeper peri- implant pockets at baseline significantly predicted the need for future surgical treatment (p = 0.031), highlighting the importance of initial disease severity in treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that the adjunctive use of systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole with NST may delay but not statistically reduce or prevent a future surgical need.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnosis and management of children with suspected Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB)-related facial nerve palsy by general practitioners (GP) and paediatricians. We conducted a prospective national survey of clinical practice between September 2018 and January 2020. The questionnaire was intended for GPs and paediatricians. It is based on two distinct clinical situations (a 10-year-old child and a 5-year-old child) and contains questions about the diagnosis and management of facial nerve palsy in children with a recent tick bite. We obtained 598 responses (350/4125 paediatricians and 245/577 GPs). For a 10-year-old child with a facial nerve palsy in the context of a tick bite, more than half of GPs (52%) required a paediatric infectious consultation and 18% an admission to the hospital for lumbar puncture before the result of Lyme serology. The most prescribed antimicrobial therapies were amoxicillin (32%) and ceftriaxone (29%). For a 5-year-old child, there is no difference in the diagnosis of LNB and treatment except for doxycycline which was less prescribed. Concerning treatment, 18% of practitioners prescribed antibiotic therapy only (14% of GPs vs 21% of paediatricians, p = 0.09), and 17% prescribed antibiotic therapy combined with corticosteroids (14% of GPs vs 19% of paediatricians, p = 0.15). Finally, 93% of GPs and 75% of paediatricians reported to be uncomfortable with the diagnosis of LNB in children. CONCLUSION: Most participants were uncomfortable with the diagnosis of LNB. There was a limited difference in the management of LNB in children between GPs and paediatricians. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is the second cause of facial nerve palsy in Europe, and its diagnosis is based on neurological symptoms and a lumbar puncture. However, no clinical criteria could be used to differentiate Bell's palsy and LNB. Moreover, data on the adjunctive corticosteroid treatment and outcome in patients with LNB-related facial nerve palsy are controversial. WHAT IS NEW: * Most participants were uncomfortable with the diagnosis of LNB. Its management was heterogeneous and most often not consistent with guidelines. Only 28% of participants requested a lumbar puncture in cases of suspected LNB, and 17% prescribed antibiotics with corticosteroids. * This study highlights the need for new specific guidelines in management (need for lumbar puncture and/or LB serology) and treatment (time to antibiotic initiation, probabilistic therapy, role of corticosteroids, doxycycline in children younger than 8 years) of LNB in children.","[('nerve palsy', 'DISEASE'), ('Lyme borreliosis', 'DISEASE'), ('Lyme neuroborreliosis', 'DISEASE'), ('facial nerve palsy', 'DISEASE'), ('nerve palsy', 'DISEASE'), ('nerve palsy', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('LNB', 'DISEASE'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('LNB', 'DISEASE'), ('LNB', 'DISEASE'), ('LNB', 'DISEASE'), ('neuroborreliosis', 'DISEASE'), ('LNB', 'DISEASE'), ('facial nerve palsy', 'DISEASE'), ('palsy', 'DISEASE'), ('LNB', 'DISEASE'), ('facial nerve palsy', 'DISEASE'), ('LNB', 'DISEASE'), ('LNB', 'DISEASE'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('LNB', 'DISEASE')]"

39378891,2024,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Escherichia coli is a global problem associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. AMR-associated genes are typically annotated based on similarity to variants in a curated reference database, with the implicit assumption that uncatalogued genetic variation within these is phenotypically unimportant. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the AMRFinder tool and, subsequently, the potential for discovering new AMR-associated gene families and characterising variation within existing ones to improve genotype-to-susceptibility phenotype predictions in E coli. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of international genome sequence data, we assembled a global dataset of 9001 E coli sequences from five publicly available data collections predominantly deriving from human bloodstream infections from: Norway, Oxfordshire (UK), Thailand, the UK, and Sweden. 8555 of these sequences had linked antibiotic susceptibility data. Raw reads were assembled using Shovill and AMR genes (relevant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and trimethoprim) extracted using the National Center for Biotechnology Information AMRFinder tool (using both default and strict [100%] coverage and identity filters). We assessed the predictive value of the presence of these genes for predicting resistance or susceptibility against US Food and Drug Administration thresholds for major and very major errors. Mash was used to calculate the similarity between extracted genes using Jaccard distances. We empirically reclustered extracted gene sequences into AMR-associated gene families (>/=70% match) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs; 100% match) and categorised these according to their frequency in the dataset. Accumulation curves were simulated and correlations between gene frequency in the Oxfordshire and other datasets calculated using the Spearman coefficient. Firth regression was used to model the association between the presence of bla(TEM-1) variants and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or piperacillin-tazobactam resistance, adjusted for the presence of other relevant ARGs. FINDINGS: The performance of the AMRFinder database for genotype-to-phenotype predictions using strict 100% identity and coverage thresholds did not meet US Food and Drug Administration thresholds for any of the seven antibiotics evaluated. Relaxing filters to default settings improved sensitivity with a specificity cost. For all antibiotics, most explainable resistance was associated with the presence of a small number of genes. There was a proportion of resistance that could not be explained by known ARGs; this ranged from 75.1% for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid to 3.4% for ciprofloxacin. Only 18 199 (51.5%) of the 35 343 ARGs detected had a 100% identity and coverage match in the AMRFinder database. After empirically reclassifying genes at 100% nucleotide sequence identity, we identified 1042 unique ARGs, of which 126 (12.1%) were present ten times or more, 313 (30.0%) were present between two and nine times, and 603 (57.9%) were present only once. Simulated accumulation curves revealed that discovery of new (100% match) ARGs present more than once in the dataset plateaued relatively quickly, whereas new singleton ARGs were discovered even after many thousands of isolates had been included. We identified a strong correlation (Spearman coefficient 0.76 [95% CI 0.73-0.80], p<0.0001) between the number of times an ARG was observed in Oxfordshire and the number of times it was seen internationally, with ARGs that were observed six times in Oxfordshire always being found elsewhere. Finally, using the example of bla(TEM-1), we showed that uncatalogued variation, including synonymous variation, is associated with potentially important phenotypic differences; for example, two common, uncatalogued bla(TEM-1) alleles with only synonymous mutations compared with the known reference were associated with reduced resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (adjusted odds ratio 0.58 [95% CI 0.35-0.95], p=0.031) and piperacillin-tazobactam (0.50 [95% CI 0.29-0.82], p=0.005). INTERPRETATION: We highlight substantial uncatalogued genetic variation with respect to known ARGs, although a relatively small proportion of these alleles are repeatedly observed in a large international dataset suggesting strong selection pressures. The current approach of using fuzzy matching for ARG detection, ignoring the unknown effects of uncatalogued variation, is unlikely to be acceptable for future clinical deployment. The association of synonymous mutations with potentially important phenotypic differences suggests that relying solely on amino acid-based gene detection to predict resistance is unlikely to be sufficient. Finally, the inability to explain all resistance using existing knowledge highlights the importance of new target gene discovery.

39376426,2024,"Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) is an inflammation of the mucoperiosteal lining of the middle ear cleft. Recently, biofilms have been discovered to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CSOM. A biofilm is a bacterial aggregation that adheres to the mucosal surfaces and is connected with an extracellular matrix. Biofilms enhance antibiotic resistance, facilitate genetic alterations and amplify competence to combat host immunity. This study aims to identify the spectrum of biofilm-producers in CSOM and investigate their antibiotic sensitivity. Samples (648) were obtained from the deeper part of external auditory meatus of patients with CSOM. Pus samples were collected and processed for culture sensitivity. Biofilms detected. The findings were compiled and statistically analyzed. Out of 500 culture-positive samples, most commonly isolated bacteria was Pseudomonas (62.6%), followed by MRSA (13.8%). Biofilm-producers were 350, with 119 being strong, 167 moderate, and 64 weak. Biofilms were produced by 70% of the isolates, with Pseudomonas producing the most (74.6%), followed by MRSA. Gentamicin was the most effective antibiotic against biofilm-producers. Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid, Ceftriaxone, Cefuroxime, and Minocyclin were resistant. Pseudomonas had the highest sensitivity to Levofloxacin (96.6%), followed by Ceftazidime and Ciprofloxacin. Pseudomonas was resistant to Cefuroxime, Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid and Linezolid. Multi-drug resistance has been widespread among CSOM causal species, particularly in biofilm producers. Thus, screening for biofilm formation, in addition to the standard antibiogram, must be undertaken as part of CSOM protocol. This will address the multi-drug resistance and select an appropriate treatment modality.","[('Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media', 'DISEASE'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial aggregation', 'DISEASE'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('Gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ceftriaxone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Minocyclin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE'), ('CSOM', 'DISEASE')]"

Here, we extensively assessed AMR in Escherichia coli isolated from urban and rural lake ecosystems using the One Health perspective. A total of 162 E. coli isolates obtained from lakes were tested against 25 antimicrobials using an in-vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing method. A low (2%) to moderate (45%) drug resistance rate was found for all antimicrobials used in human/veterinary medicine or animal/plant agriculture. However, <80% E. coli isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype to highly important (amikacin, gentamicin, trimethoprim) or critically important (amoxicillin, ampicillin, colistin) drugs of both human and veterinary medicine. Of concern, >50% of E. coli isolates exhibited MDR to drugs used as last-resorts (chloramphenicol, colistin) or as frontline (nitrofurantoin, sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, gentamicin) against E. coli infections.

39375834,2024,"With the escalation of hospital-acquired infections by multidrug resistant bacteria, understanding antibiotic resistance is of paramount importance. This study focuses on the beta-lactamase gene, blaOXA-58, an important resistance determinant identified in a patient-facing hospital wastewater system. This study aimed to characterize the behaviour of the OXA-58 enzyme when expressed using a non-native plasmid and expression host. blaOXA-58 was cloned using a pET28a(+)/Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) expression system. Nitrocefin hydrolysis and antimicrobial susceptibility of OXA-58-producing cells were assessed against penicillin G, ampicillin, meropenem, and amoxicillin. blaOXA-58 conferred resistance to amoxicillin, penicillin G, and ampicillin, but not to meropenem. This was unexpected given OXA-58's annotation as a carbapenemase. The presence of meropenem also reduced nitrocefin hydrolysis, suggesting it acts as a competitive inhibitor of the OXA-58 enzyme. This study elucidates the phenotypic resistance conferred by an antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) obtained from a clinically relevant setting and reveals that successful functional expression of ARGs is multifaceted. This study challenges the reliability of predicting antimicrobial resistance based solely on gene sequence alone, and serves as a reminder of the intricate interplay between genetics and structural factors in understanding resistance profiles across different host environments.","[('hospital-acquired infections', 'DISEASE'), ('blaOXA-58', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('blaOXA-58', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL')]"

The diarrhea improved with rifaximin (RFX), but recurred repeatedly after its discontinuation. Antibiotic rotation, wherein RFX, amoxicillin hydrate and potassium clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, and RFX were administered in this order for 4 weeks each, improved the diarrhea. A lactulose breath test performed immediately before the second RFX course yielded negative results.

P . multocida is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic cocco-bacillus and a common member of the oral bacterial flora of cats and dogs. In humans, it commonly causes skin and wound infections after bites and scratches. Disseminated P . multocida infection seeded into the heart valve is very rare and has only been reported in about one case per year worldwide with only 42 cases found in the literature and only five cases reported to have underlying liver cirrhosis as in our case. This is a case of a 73-year-old female with a past medical history of Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis secondary to primary biliary cholangitis with portal hypertension, splenomegaly, pancytopenia, severe aortic stenosis, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented to hospital with generalized weakness, fever, and new lower extremity rash 48 hours after last dose of antibiotic. She had recent hospitalization for left lower extremity cellulitis and P. multocida bacteremia and received 14 days of high-dose oral amoxicillin-clavulanate with negative blood culture prior to discharge. She occasionally helps her son to feed his cats and dog whenever he travels. She was readmitted and a repeat blood culture showed P. multocida. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a 1.9 cm x 1 cm mobile mass attached to the anterior mitral valve leaflet, which was new compared to the prior study obtained during her first admission. She was not a suitable candidate for valve surgery due to her comorbidities. P. multocida was found to be susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, levofloxacin with negative beta lactamase.

However, minimizing the risks, particularly those associated with emerging contaminants that may induce resistance among pathogens in wastewater, is crucial. This study assessed the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in untreated wastewater used for agricultural purposes and evaluated the quantifiable health risks associated with this practice in Tamale, Ghana. The resistance of some Enterobacteriaceae, such as E. coli, Klebsiella, and Salmonella-Shigella, to four commonly used antibiotics in Ghana was assessed using a conventional microbiological culture approach and the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. A Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) was performed to estimate the health risks associated with two distinct scenarios of wastewater reuse: (1) accidental ingestion of contaminated wastewater and soil, and (2) consumption of vegetables irrigated with wastewater. This approach applied a Monte Carlo simulation based on 10,000 interactions and identified E. coli O157:H7 as the reference pathogen. Among Enterobacteriaceae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella-Shigella and E. coli were isolated, in concentrations exceeding the limit recommended by the World Health Organization (10(3) CFU/100 ml). All the isolated bacteria were resistant to metronidazole (5 mug). Thirty-three per cent of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were intermediate/moderately susceptible, and all other bacteria were resistant to amoxicillin (30 mug). All Klebsiella pneumoniae and the majority of Salmonella-Shigella (69.8 %) isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (25 mug) and tetracycline (30 mug). When assessing health risks, the mean annual probability of infection associated with consuming vegetables irrigated with wastewater varied between 5.14 x 10(-2) and 9.79 x 10(-1) per person per year. Conversely, for the accidental ingestion scenario, the probability was 1.00 per person per year. In these scenarios, the probability of illness ranged from 1.29 x 10(-2) to 2.4 x 10(-1) and 2.5 x 10(-1) per person per year.

39366454,2025,"INTRODUCTION: This cross-sectional study assesses the prevalence of metronidazole resistance-associated mutations and virulence genotypes in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains isolated from the Egyptian population. H. pylori infection is a significant public health concern, with antibiotic resistance challenging its eradication. METHODS: Gastric biopsy samples were collected from symptomatic patients referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at selected healthcare facilities. The study included 250 participants with symptoms suggestive of H. pylori infection and aged 18 years or older. Biopsy samples were obtained using standard endoscopic techniques, and H. pylori strains were isolated and identified in the laboratory. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using standard methods. Molecular analysis, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, was performed to identify metronidazole resistance-associated mutations (rdxA and frxA) and virulence genotypes (cagA and vacA). RESULTS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that 43.6 % of the isolates were resistant to metronidazole, while 11.8 %, 4.5 %, and 55.4 % were resistant to clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and levofloxacin. Molecular analysis identified rdxA and frxA mutations in 36.3 % and 31.8 % of the isolates, respectively, indicating metronidazole resistance-associated mutations. Additionally, 60.0 % of the isolates were positive for the cagA gene, and 80.0 % had the vacA s1 type, both associated with increased virulence. A significant association was found between metronidazole resistance and the presence of cagA gene, vacA s1 type, rdxA mutation, and frxA mutation. Statistical analysis revealed associations between specific mutations and virulence genotypes with respective odds ratios, indicating higher likelihoods of metronidazole resistance in isolates exhibiting these genetic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the prevalence of metronidazole resistance and the association between specific mutations and virulence genotypes in H. pylori strains isolated from the Egyptian population. The findings underscore the importance of monitoring antibiotic resistance patterns and understanding the genetic determinants of virulence in H. pylori for effective management and treatment strategies.","[('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('pylori infection', 'DISEASE'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('frxA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('frxA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL')]"

The functional coating is composed of a porous oxide layer (formed by a plasma electrolytic oxidation process) and a polymer poly(sebacic anhydride) (PSBA) layer loaded with amoxicillin (formed by dip coatings). The coatings were porous and composed of Ca (4.16%-6.54%) and P (7.64%-9.89% determined by scanning electron microscopy with EDX) in the upper part of the implant. The titanium bone wedges were hydrophilic (54 degrees  water contact angle) and rough (surface area (Sa):1.16 mum) The surface tension determined using diiodomethane was 68.6 +/- 2.0 degrees for the anodized implant and was similar for hybrid coatings: 60.7 +/- 2.2 degrees . 12.87 +/- 0.91 microg/mL of amoxicillin was released from the implants during the first 30 min after immersion in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. This concentration was enough to inhibit the Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228 growth. The obtained inhibition zones were between 27.3 +/- 2.1 mm-30.7 +/- 0.6 mm when implant extract after 1 h or 4 h immersion in PBS was collected.

However, lack of long-term temporal surveillance data on AMR in countries with high burden like Bangladesh is scarce. Our study explores the AMR trends of Salmonella Typhi isolates from Bangladesh, drawing comparisons with antibiotic consumption to optimize antibiotic stewardship strategies for the country. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The typhoid fever surveillance from 1999 to 2022 included two pediatric hospitals and three private clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Blood cultures were performed at treating physicians' discretion; cases were confirmed by microbiological, serological, and biochemical tests. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined following CLSI guidelines. National antibiotic consumption data for cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and azithromycin was obtained from IQVIA-MIDAS database for comparison. Over the 24 years of surveillance, we recorded 12,435 culture-confirmed typhoid cases and observed declining resistance to first-line drugs (amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole); multidrug resistance (MDR) decreased from 38% in 1999 to 17% in 2022. Cotrimoxazole consumption dropped from 0.8 to 0.1 Daily defined doses (DDD)/1000/day (1999-2020). Ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility persisted at >90% with unchanged consumption (1.1-1.3 DDD/1000/day, 2002-2020). Low ceftriaxone resistance (<1%) was observed, with slightly rising MIC (0.03 to 0.12 mg/L, 1999-2019). Azithromycin consumption increased (0.1 to 3.8 DDD/1000/day, 1999-2020), but resistance remained </=4%. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights declining MDR amongst Salmonella Typhi in Bangladesh; first-line antimicrobials could be reintroduced as empirical treatment options for typhoid fever if MDR rates further drops below 5%.

METHODS: This was a time-series analysis of antibiotics prescribed by dental practitioners between January 2011 and December 2021. The outcome variables were number of defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD/1000 population/year in a sample of cities in MG. Covariates were public oral healthcare factors, such as coverage, estimates of dental procedures, and frequency of dental pain. Linear time-series regression models were used to examine trends and the influence of covariates on antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS: Overall, the number of prescriptions increased by 334.69% between 2011 and 2021, with amoxicillin being the most commonly prescribed drug (78.53%). The number of DDD for all antibiotics increased from 17,147.13 to 77,346.67 and the average DDD/1000 inhabitants/year was 126.66 (SD: 130.28).

Yet, its impact on fetomaternal outcomes remains unexplored, hindering the development of screening strategies, antimicrobial therapies, and preventive measures for this vulnerable population. METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on 1,093 pregnant women admitted for delivery at Bugando Medical Center (BMC) in Mwanza, Tanzania, from July to December 2022. Socio-demographic, obstetric, and clinical data were collected from the women, along with mid-stream urine samples for analysis. Fetomaternal outcomes were assessed within 72 hours after delivery. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years (range: 15-45 years). ASB prevalence among pregnant women was 16.9% (185/1093), with a 95% CI of 14.6-19.3%. Risk factors for ASB included anemia (OR: 5.3; 95% CI = 3.7-8.2, p-value <0.001) and a history of antenatal care admission (OR 4.2; 95% CI = 2.9-6.1, p-value <0.001). Among all participants, 82 (7.5%), 65 (5.9%), 49 (4.5%), and 79 (7.2%) experienced pre-term labor (PTL), premature rupture of membrane (PROM), preeclampsia, and delivered newborns with low birthweight (LBW), respectively. Among the 185 patients with ASB, the respective proportions of PTL, PROM, preeclampsia, and LBW were 25.4%, 17.3%, 9.2%, and 12.4%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed significant associations between ASB and PTL [OR (95% CI): 8.8 (5.5-14.5); p-value <0.001], PROM [OR (95% CI): 4.5 (2.5-8.0); p-value <0.001], and LBW [OR (95% CI): 2.0 (1.2-3.5); p-value = 0.011].

39353733,2025,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic overuse is associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It is unclear whether community AMR is driven by overall antibiotic use or by high levels of repeated (intense) use by individual patients. AIM: To determine the association between high antibiotic prescribing intensity (all antibiotic prescriptions; any indication), and rates of urinary tract infection (UTI) resistance among patients within small communities. DESIGN & SETTING: Repeated cross-sectional ecological analysis of geographical areas (population averaging 1500) from 2012-2015 using anonymised primary care data and urine cultures. METHOD: For each area, we compared the percentage of patients prescribed antibiotics who received>/=5 prescriptions over 3 years or>/=4 prescriptions over 1 year, with subsequent or same year UTI resistance rates. We also compared Average Daily Quantities (ADQ) of all antibiotics prescribed, with UTI resistance rates, per year, per area. Results were adjusted for covariates and analysed at area level using mixed effects logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 196 513 patients prescribed antibiotics in 69 areas, 16% were prescribed intensively (>/=5 prescriptions in 3 years), receiving almost 30% of prescriptions. Of 12 308 confirmed UTI specimens (80% Escherichia coli), 65% were resistant to at least one antibiotic (amoxicillin; cefalexin; ciprofloxacin; trimethoprim; nitrofurantoin). We found no significant association between high intensity 'any' antibiotic prescribing (same year or 2 preceding years) or overall 'any' antibiotic prescribing (same year) and UTI resistance. CONCLUSION: We found no relationship between concurrent high intensity 'any' antibiotic prescribing, and UTI resistance rates in small urban communities, pre-COVID-19. Individual patient use of multiple antibiotics, even at high intensity, may not be an independent risk factor for community UTI resistance.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefalexin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39354215,2024,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the improvement of the intestinal barrier and gut microbiota in mice with antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) using Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ELF051 combined with Astragalus polysaccharides. The amoxicillin, clindamycin, and streptomycin triple-mixed antibiotic-induced AAD models were administered with L. plantarum ELF051 or Astragalus polysaccharides or L. plantarum ELF051 + Astragalus polysaccharides for 14 days. Our findings revealed that the combination of L. plantarum ELF051 and Astragalus polysaccharides elevated the number of goblet cells and enhanced the proportion of mucous within the colon tissue. Furthermore, the expression of sIgA and IgG were upregulated, while the levels of IL-17A, IL-4, DAO, D-LA, LPS, and TGF-beta1 were downregulated. L. plantarum ELF051 combined with Astragalus polysaccharides elevated the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, facilitating intestinal mucosal repair via Smad signaling nodes. Furthermore, their combination effectively increased the relative abundance of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Allobaculum, and decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroides and Blautia. Spearman rank correlation analysis demonstrated that LAB were closely related to permeability factors, immune factors, and indicators of intestinal barrier function. In summary, the effect of combining L. plantarum ELF051 and Astragalus polysaccharides on AAD mice was achieved by enhancing intestinal barrier function and regulating the composition of the gut microbiota.","[('antibiotic-associated diarrhea', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('streptomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('antibiotic-induced AAD', 'DISEASE'), ('L. plantarum ELF051', 'DISEASE'), ('L. plantarum ELF051 + Astragalus polysaccharides', 'CHEMICAL'), ('L. plantarum ELF051', 'CHEMICAL'), ('D-LA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('L. plantarum ELF051', 'CHEMICAL'), ('lactic acid bacteria', 'DISEASE'), ('L. plantarum ELF051', 'CHEMICAL')]"

In recent years, increasing resistance of H. pylori to clarithromycin and amoxicillin have decreased peptic ulcer cure rate following treatment with standard triple therapy worldwide. The addition of probiotics with standard triple therapy has shown excellent efficacy in H. pylori eradication and has appeared to be an alternative treatment strategy. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of standard triple therapy plus probiotics for H. pylori eradication and ulcer healing compared to standard triple therapy alone. This double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial included 158 with endoscopically proven H. pylori-positive PUD who were randomly allocated equally into two groups; Group A was treated with standard triple therapy plus probiotics, and Group B was treated with standard triple therapy plus placebo for 14 days. The outcome was evaluated at the end of treatment (14th day) (symptoms plus adverse events) and after 60 days of treatment completion (H. pylori eradication and ulcer healing). One hundred forty four (144) study subjects (73 in Group A and 71 in Group B) completed the study. Significantly higher H. pylori eradication rate (82.2%vs. 67.6%, p=0.043) and ulcer healing rate (92.3% vs. 60.0%, p=0.049) were observed in the standard triple therapy plus probiotic group than the standard triple therapy plus placebo group. Early relief of epigastric pain was also seen among patients getting probiotics than the placebo in addition to standard triple therapy (42.3% vs. 15.1%, p<0.001).The addition of probiotics significantly improves the H. pylori eradication rate and ulcer healing rate among the patients getting standard triple therapy.

The aim of the study was to evaluate shelf-life values of amoxicillin at clinical concentrations in the presence of clavulanate for use in OPAT. METHODS: A stability-indicating HPLC assay was developed and validated. Kinetic studies were performed at 1 mg/mL and 15 mg/mL amoxicillin at 40-60  degrees C. Studies in elastomeric infusers included the pH lowered from 8.73 to 6.52 for 1 mg/mL; 8.85 to 7.69 for 7.5 mg/mL and 8.68 to 8.40 for 15 mg/mL amoxicillin plus clavulanate and stored at 2.9  degrees C. RESULTS: Amoxicillin and clavulanate eluted at 5.2 and 3.0 minutes, respectively, with linear concentration relationships. Forced degradation retained base-line separation of each component in the presence of degradation products. Amoxicillin 1 mg/mL had a shelf-life of 4.85 hours at pH 6.53 and 40  degrees C which on extrapolation to 25  degrees C was 22.8 h. Clavulanate was 1.38 h at 40  degrees C and 4.0 h at 25  degrees C. Amoxicillin 15 mg/mL at pH 8.34 gave a shelf-life of 0.11 h at 40  degrees C and clavulanate 0.41 h. In elastomeric infusers, amoxicillin 1 mg/mL, with lowering pH from 8.73 to 6.52, improved the shelf-life at 2.9  degrees C from 72 to >263.8 h and similarly for clavulanate. At 7.5 mg/mL amoxicillin, lowering pH from 8.85 to 7.69 improved the shelf-life from 4.2 to 51.8 h and clavulanate from 4.2 to 48.0 h. At 15 mg/mL amoxicillin, the shelf-life values at pH 8.68 or 8.40 were 3.8 h and 1.6 h and similarly for clavulanate. CONCLUSION: Amoxicillin and clavulanate showed adequate stability at 2.9  degrees C for OPAT storage at 1 mg/mL and possibly 7.5 mg/mL, but not 15 mg/mL.

RESULTS: The observed prescribing rate was 8 DID, with penicillins accounting for 4.6 DID (57.2%). The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, making up 4.4 DID. If all the 30-dose presentations of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate had been 20-dose containers, the total number of DIDs would have been 3.3, resulting in a reduction of 1.1 DID (25.4% less).

39347572,2024,"We investigated the effects of Candida albicans colonization on inflammatory responses in the murine glandular stomach, which is similar to the glandular mucosa of the human stomach. We also explored whether the presence of a food allergy could exacerbate C. albicans-induced inflammation or if C. albicans would amplify allergic inflammation in the glandular stomach. C. albicans successfully colonized the stomach of amoxicillin-pre-treated BALB/c mice and induced gastritis in the limiting ridge with minimal inflammation in the glandular stomach. There was significant upregulation of Il18, calprotectin (S100a8 and S100a9), and several antimicrobial peptides, but minimal induction of type 1, 2, or 3 responses in the glandular stomach. A robust type 2 response, inflammatory cell recruitment, and tissue remodeling occurred in the glandular stomach following oral ovalbumin challenges in sensitized mice. The type 2 response was not augmented by C. albicans colonization, but there was significant upregulation of Il1b, Il12a, Tnf, and Il17a in C. albicans-colonized food allergic mice. The presence of C. albicans did not affect the expression of genes involved in barrier integrity and signaling, many of which were upregulated during food allergy. Overall, our data indicate that C. albicans colonization induces minimal inflammation in the glandular stomach but augments antimicrobial peptide expression. Induction of a food allergy results in robust type 2 inflammation in the glandular stomach, and while C. albicans colonization does not exacerbate type 2 inflammation, it does activate a number of innate and type 3 immune responses amid the backdrop of allergic inflammation. IMPORTANCE: Food allergy continues to be a growing public health concern, affecting at least 1 in 10 individuals in the United States alone. However, little is known about the involvement of the gastric mucosa in food allergy. Gastrointestinal Candida albicans colonization has been reported to promote gastrointestinal inflammation in a number of chronic diseases.

The current study aimed to isolate, identify, and characterize ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and their antimicrobial resistance pattern in retail cattle meat samples. A comprehensive set of 225 cattle meat samples was gathered from 13 upazilas within the Sylhet district of Bangladesh. The bacterial isolates were obtained through biochemical and cultural techniques, and the identification of K. pneumoniae was accomplished using polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). Antimicrobial susceptibilities were assessed using disk diffusion in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2020) guidelines. Genes encoding ESBL enzymes were detected by the double-disk synergy test (DDST) and multiplex PCR. The overall prevalence of Klebsiella spp. was 28.89% (65/225), whereas the positive percentage of K. pneumoniae was 59.2% (29/49) confirmed by PCR. Antimicrobial resistance was observed against 12 antibiotics.

The appearance of many harmful substances in the waters has resulted in so-called chemical cocktails which significantly contribute to the deterioration of water quality. Additionally, the variety of these compounds, often similar to each other in terms of molecular weights, makes their separation and identification very difficult. In this paper we present the possibility of using self-regenerating mechanism of molecularly imprinted polymers to measure the concentration of micropollutants in the aquatic environment. Molecularly imprinted polymers toward gentamicin were prepared by monomer polymerization in aqueous solution at ambient temperature. Results from computer-based molecular modelling demonstrated potential binding sites between gentamicin and functional monomers in water. Various compositions of polymerization mixtures were tested. The ratio of monomers to each other was 1.1:1.4:0.0015 and 1:1:1 for N-isopropylacrylamine:acrylamide:acrylic acid, respectively. For each composition, various amounts of the standard were tested: 0, 3, 5, 7, 10,15 mol% in relation to monomers.

Misuse and overuse of antibiotics has been shown to significantly contribute to the development of resistant bacteria. However, the antibiotic prescribing practices of dentists in Ethiopia have not been thoroughly studied. This study aimed to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing for patients with dental diseases at dental clinics in Mekelle City, Northern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted in April and May 2020 among patients visiting dental clinics in Mekelle City. Data were collected through patient medical record reviews and dentist interviews. The appropriateness of antibiotic prescription was evaluated based on guidelines from the American Dental Association and the European Society of Endodontology. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics, version 29. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed, and the results were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-one patients with dental diseases participated in the study. The mean age was 30.6 years with a standard deviation of 16.1. Most participants had dental pulp related disease. 89% of patients were prescribed antibiotics, with amoxicillin being the most common. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing was identified in 175 (75.8%) of the study participants. The most common inappropriate prescribing was unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for dental conditions without systemic signs, assessed in 141 (80.1%) participants. Patients diagnosed with pulp related disease without systemic signs and those who had tooth extractions were significantly associated with inappropriate antibiotic prescription (p value < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study findings show that antibiotics are over-prescribed for dental conditions in this resource constrained setting, especially in patients who have had tooth extractions.

RESULTS: A 68-year-old male was admitted to the hospital due to severe abdominal pain. The patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable with elevated C-reactive protein levels. A physical examination revealed a palpable, pulsatile, tender mass located in the periumbilical region.

Although the primary agent in CLA's etiology is Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, some other opportunistic microorganisms also play a role. Therefore, the control and treatment of CLA necessitates the identification of the relevant etiological agents. This study aimed to conduct an in vitro culture and molecular characterization (PCR analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing) of the bacteria involved in sheep CLA cases reported in the Cankiri province of Turkiye and determine the antibiotic susceptibility of the case isolates. In total, 82 (16.4%) of 500 sheep in five farms were diagnosed with CLA. Following the culture of the superficial abscesses samples, C. pseudotuberculosis was identified in 30 (36.59%) as a result of PCR, Pseudomonas spp. in 8 (9.76%), and Enterobacter cancerogenus in 1 (1.22%), as a result of 16S rRNA sequencing. These data revealed extensive heterogeneity among the Pseudomonas isolates, with hints of derivation from a common ancestry for some and phylogenetic similarity to isolates from Germany, Malaysia, and India. In contrast to the high susceptibility to cefoperazone and lincomycin, the high resistances of C. pseudotuberculosis and Pseudomonas spp. isolates to cephalothin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, amoxicillin, and bacitracin were remarkable. Based on these findings, it was concluded that for an effective treatment and control of ovine CLA cases, there is a need to consider the possible involvement of opportunistic bacteria other than the primary causative agent, C. pseudotuberculosis.

39335048,2024,"BACKGROUNDS: Antibiotics are used in endodontic treatment to control acute odontogenic infection and for prophylactic purposes. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge of dentists from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina about the choice and the routes of antibiotic administration in endodontics. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved dentists in Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina health institutions. The Dental Chamber sent a twelve-question survey to members' email addresses. They were asked about the type, dosage, indications, and side effects of antibiotics used in endodontics. The obtained data were screened and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 180 questionnaires were filled out. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin with clavulanic acid. Pulp necrosis with symptomatic apical periodontitis, swelling, and moderately severe symptoms were the main indications for the therapeutic use of antibiotics. Amoxicillin, administered orally at 2 g 1 h before endodontic surgery for patients with bacterial endocarditis, was mostly indicated for the prophylactic use of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, we can conclude that dentists from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina have limited knowledge regarding antibiotic use in endodontics. Educational activities and campaigns are necessary to raise awareness about antibiotics in dental medicine in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.","[('acute odontogenic infection', 'DISEASE'), ('necrosis', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontitis', 'DISEASE'), ('swelling', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bacterial endocarditis', 'DISEASE')]"
39335046,2024,"Prescribing antibiotics is a regular part of daily dental practice. Antibiotics have a significant but a limited role in general dental practice due to the threat of emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). As such, the aim of this study was to assess prescribing trends in dental antibiotics use from 2014-2023 in Croatia. Data on antibiotic prescribing practices for this study were provided by the Croatian Health Insurance Fund. The analysis included the number of prescriptions, packages, cost, and the World Health Organization's defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants (DID) per day as an objective utilization for comparison. Over the 10-year period, dentists in Croatia prescribed an annual average of 357,875 antibiotic prescriptions, representing an annual average of 78.7% of all dental prescriptions. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic was the combination of amoxicillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, which made up 58.54% of antibiotics and 46.1% of all dental prescriptions. This was followed by amoxicillin (12.61%), clindamycin (12.58%), and metronidazole (9.96%). The trend showed two discontinuations, the first for the pandemic years, and the second caused by disruption in amoxicillin production. The rise in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics needs to be addressed and regulated to ensure patients and dentists understand that antibiotics are not a substitute for dental treatment. Dentists should always begin treatment with narrow-spectrum antibiotics regardless of possible exceptional circumstances.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pandemic', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"

Of the 33 antibiotics inventoried, amoxicillin tablets and oxytetracycline were the most recognized and used antibiotics. This study indicated that antibiotics were used for a range of health problems in the community, some of which were administered as painkillers. While primary healthcare facilities constituted the primary source of drugs for households (76.8%), informal drug sellers constituted an additional option (61.5%) for community members. This is a significant concern, given that some antibiotics classified as ""Watch""-such as norfloxacin-were readily available in these outlets, despite not being included on the country's Essential Medicines List.

This study examined changing trends in F-UTI epidemiology and resistance patterns among Israeli pediatric inpatients over a decade. Methods: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data for children between 3 months and 18 years old with febrile UTI from 2010 to 2021 were retrieved from electronic medical records. Results: A total of 761 cases of F-UTI were identified (702 females, mean age 43 months). Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (85.9%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4%). Compared with the non-complicated UTI group, the complicated UTI group had significantly higher rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.3% vs. 1.0%, p = 0.002) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.6% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.03). Antibiotic resistance analysis revealed significant differences between the groups: resistance to cephalexin was higher in the complicated UTI group (19.3%) compared with the non-complicated UTI group (13.4%, p = 0.03). Notably, relatively low resistance rates were observed for ceftriaxone (4.4%) and gentamicin (6.0%). Over time, a significant decreasing trend in resistance to ampicillin was observed (slope = -0.0193, p = 0.011). No significant trends were found for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, and cefuroxime. Conclusions: Significant differences in pathogen distribution and resistance patterns between complicated UTI and non-complicated UTI groups highlight the need for continuous resistance monitoring and adherence to local guidelines. For the treatment of severe community F-UTI, ceftriaxone could be a reasonable option for first-onset F-UTI.

However, little is known about using attractive garden plants in C.W.s to eliminate antibiotics. Thus, the current study aims to treat amoxicillin (AMX)-contaminated wastewater through a Rhapis excelsa-based bioretention system (BS). The investigation was done at 15 days hydraulic retention time (HRT) under two conditions: set-1, varied AMX 5 to 25 ppm with constant NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) source; and set-2, varied NPK sources with constant AMX (25 ppm). During the study, it was observed that in the set-1 condition with increasing AMX concentration, the removal of AMX through BS decreased; however, in the set-2 experiment, with enhancing NPK source, the performance of the BS treating 25-ppm AMX-contaminated wastewater increased. AMX removal of 2.3%, 66.3%, 60.6%, 52.2%, 46.7%, and 44.9% was achieved for control, BS-1, BS-2, BS-3, BS-4, and BS-5, respectively, during set-1 experiment.

This study aimed to investigate the current state of knowledge and practices concerning H. pylori infection management among physicians in Gansu Province, northwest China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October to November 2023, 557 physicians from 14 cities and prefectures in Gansu Province participated in this multicenter cross-sectional study and completed a survey questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 519 valid questionnaires were collected. 43.2% of the physicians supported H. pylori screening for high-risk populations or individuals with H. pylori-related diseases. The awareness of target screening populations varied among these physicians, ranging from 69.6% to 98.2%. Most physicians preferred the urea breath test (UBT) as the method for diagnosing H. pylori infection (98.3%) and for follow-up after eradication therapy (98.5%). 89.6% of the physicians preferred bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for initial eradication, with amoxicillin and clarithromycin being the most commonly used antibiotic combination (56.3%). In addition, 84.6% of the physicians indicated that they would inquire about the antibiotic usage history for most patients before treatment, 93.8% would ask patients about their previous eradication history, and 94.2% would inform patients about treatment-related considerations. However, only 43.5%, 27.7%, and 29.7% of the physicians were aware of the high resistance rates of H. pylori to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, respectively, in Gansu Province.

The human stomach serves as its primary reservoir. Complaints about stomach complication due to H. pylori infections are reported in the majority of populations around the globe. Chronic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia of the gastric mucosa are major complications of a long-term H. pylori infections that can lead to gastric cancer in severe cases. This study aims to characterize H. pylori isolates from gastroenteritis patients and to determine the resistance of H. pylori to various antibiotics. METHODS: In the current study, a total of (n = 80) gastric biopsy samples were randomly collected from gastroenteritis patients in brain-heart infusion broth. These were inoculated on Columbia blood agar supplemented with Helicobacter pylori selective supplement (DENT). After culturing, Microscopy and biochemical tests were performed. The susceptibility profile of H. pylori isolates was evaluated using the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. On the basis of the drug resistance profile, a total of (n = 20) isolates including (n = 10) from females and (n = 10) from males were selected for the detection and characterization of resistant genes. After confirmation of H. pylori using 16s rRNA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done for the detection of resistance genes including Metronidazole resistance (rdxA gene), Clarithromycin resistance (23s rRNA gene) and Amoxicillin resistance (Penicillin-binding protein A1 (pbpA1) gene). RESULTS: In a total of (n = 80) samples, H. pylori was isolated from 72.5% (n = 58) samples. Among the positive patients, there were 62% (n = 36) of female positive patients while in males, its ratio was 38% (n = 22). It was more common in the age between 30-50 years 55.17% (n = 32). It has shown the highest resistance towards Metronidazole 90% (n = 52), and the lowest toward Levofloxacin 65% (n = 38). Metronidazole resistance gene (rdxA gene) was detected in (n = 13) isolates including (n = 9) isolates from females and (n = 4) from males. In the case of, the Clarithromycin resistance gene (23s rRNA) (n = 10) was positive for H. pylori including (n = 6) isolates from females and (n = 7) were positive for Amoxicillin (pbpA1 gene) including (n = 2) in female and (n = 5) from male patients. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the increasing incidence of H. pylori infections in both male and female patients.

39321970,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) causes several gastrointestinal diseases. Its virulence factors contributing to disease development include biofilm formation, cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) proteins that induce host tissue damage. In addition, urease activity enables H. pylori growth in the gastric acidic environment. This work aimed to characterize bacterial factors associated with biofilm production among 89 clinical H. pylori isolates, collected from patient gastric biopsies. METHODS: Biofilm production was detected using the crystal violet method. PCR was performed to determine vacA genotype (s1m1, s1m2, s2m1 and s2m2) and cagA gene presence. Urease activity was measured via the phenol red method. Susceptibility to six antibiotics was assessed by the Etest method. RESULTS: Most H. pylori isolates produced biofilm. No association was found between biofilm-formation capacity and cagA presence or vacA genotype. Urease activity levels varied across isolates; no association was found between biofilm-formation and urease activity. Clarithromycin resistance was measured in 49 % of the isolates. Isolates susceptible to tetracycline were more commonly strong biofilm producers. In contrast, a significantly higher rate of strong biofilm producers was observed among resistant isolates to amoxicillin, levofloxacin and rifampicin, compared to susceptible isolates. Non-biofilm producers were more common among isolates sensitive to rifampicin and metronidazole, compared to resistant isolates.

39321882,2024,"Water contamination with pharmaceuticals has become an evident environmental challenge. Treatment processes such as electrochemical oxidation (EO) and adsorption have limitations in the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals from water. Therefore, this study examined the potential of coupled process (EO followed by adsorption) in binary pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen (ACM) + ciprofloxacin (CIP)) removal from water, with an emphasis on coupled process optimization. Consequently, optimized coupled process conditions including current density (22 mA/cm(2)), pH (5.5), EO time (40 min), adsorbent dose (0.1 g/L) and adsorption time (60 min) were obtained. Under optimal conditions, removal efficiencies of 94.6% (ACM)+92% (CIP), 94.07% (ACM)+91.15% (CIP), and > 99.8% (ACM + CIP) were recorded for 20 mg/L (ACM + CIP) removal in EO, adsorption and EO + adsorption, respectively. Further, the coupled process was employed in multiple pharmaceuticals (20 mg/L of ACM + CIP + ATN (atenolol) + AMX (amoxicillin)) removal from water and removal of > 97.56% (ACM + CIP + ATN + AMX) was achieved. Removal efficiencies of ACM (83.35%) + CIP (73.1%) + ATN (68.52%) + AMX (63.05%) and ACM (80.37%) + CIP (66.5%) + ATN (73.07%) + AMX (60.5%) were obtained in EO and adsorption, respectively.

The total organic carbon (TOC) removal of 40.24%, and 99% and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 72.45%, and 99.6% were obtained under optimal conditions of EO, and coupled process, respectively. These findings indicate that the pharmaceuticals are only partially mineralized in EO and the subsequent adsorption effectively eliminated the remaining target pharmaceuticals, and degradation by-products from water. Additionally, integrating EO with adsorption reduced the electrical energy consumption of the EO process from 31.6 kWh/m(3) to 6 kWh/m(3) under optimal conditions.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, antibiotic resistance pattern, and associated factors of Streptococcus pyogenes among pediatric patients suspected of acute pharyngitis in Sidama Region, Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 213 acute pharyngitis suspected pediatric patients from April to September 2022 at Hawassa University Compressive Specialized Hospital and Yirgalem Hospital. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire. A throat swab was cultured to isolate S. pyogenes, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using standard bacteriological techniques. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25, and P value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULT: Out of 213 throat swabs cultured, 22 (10.3%) with 95% CI (6.6-14.6%) were S. pyogenes positive. All isolates of S. pyogenes were sensitive to penicillin and amoxicillin. In contrast, 8 (36.4%) isolates exhibited resistance to tetracycline, 7 (31.8%) to ceftriaxone, 6 (27.3%) to erythromycin, and 5 (22.7%) isolates showed multidrug resistance.

An analysis was performed per country. Comparisons were done with the Fisher's exact test (statistical significance with p < 0.05). KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Out of 423 participating urologists, most regularly performed catheter changes and managed catheter-related issues, except for French urologists. Swiss urologists tended to change the catheter after a longer interval. In France, a higher estimated number of CAUTIs were observed. Diagnostic symptoms and measures varied significantly between countries. French urologists prescribed more antimicrobials per patient and administered longer treatment regimens. The choice of antimicrobial agents differed notably for nonfebrile and febrile CAUTIs, with cotrimoxazole/nitrofurantoin being common for nonfebrile cases and cephalosporin/amoxicillin for febrile ones. Follow-up protocols were similar among urologists, while prophylactic measures showed variations. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: CAUTI management varied notably across countries in terms of diagnostics, treatment, and prophylaxis. Discrepancies in antimicrobial therapy could be influenced by local resistance rates; yet, nonrecommended drugs and prolonged regimens, as compared with guideline recommendations, were common. This trend, along with inappropriate diagnostics and prophylaxis, may increase antimicrobial resistance and CAUTI morbidity. This study emphasizes the necessity for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship interventions, and proper training in CAUTI management. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this questionnaire-based study examining the clinical practices for managing urinary tract infections in patients with bladder catheters (CAUTIs), significant disparities were observed among European urologists regarding diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis. These findings underscore the critical need for clear guidelines and comprehensive training in CAUTI management.","[('Catheter-associated urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('nonfebrile', 'DISEASE'), ('febrile CAUTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('nonfebrile', 'DISEASE'), ('febrile', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTI', 'DISEASE'), ('inappropriate diagnostics', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTI', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTI', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('CAUTI', 'DISEASE')]"
39317916,2025,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is not known for most prescription medications. We aimed to estimate the incidence of DILI for commonly prescribed outpatient drugs. METHODS: To establish a baseline estimate of DILI incidence, we used the estimated incidence (EI) of amoxicillin/clavulanate DILI from a previous population-based study in Iceland. This was combined with the multicenter prospective DILI Network (DILIN) cohort and the US population-based Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). From 2005 to 2019, prescription drugs with at least five bona fide DILIN cases and data from at least 10 of the 15 years from MEPS during that timeframe were included. The EI for 'drug A' was calculated as follows: EI(drug A) = EI(AC) x / x / RESULTS: In total, 30 drugs met the inclusion criteria, of which 11 were antibiotics, 4 were antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), 4 were statins, and 11 were other drug types. The highest EI was seen with azathioprine and older AEDs, with one DILI case per 349-2329 new prescriptions. The EI of antibiotics ranged greatly, with the highest risk seen for minocycline, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and nitrofurantoin (approximately 1:1000-2400 new prescriptions), and lowest risk for clindamycin, doxycycline, azithromycin, and amoxicillin (approximately 1:40,000-170,000 new prescriptions). The EI for commonly prescribed statins was approximately 1:10,000-50,000. Important medication classes with > 5 million new prescriptions from 2005 to 2019 but fewer than five DILIN cases included beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and metformin, which presumably have very low DILI incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The highest EI was found for azathioprine, older antiepileptics, and minocycline. In contrast, many widely used drugs are rare causes of DILI. These findings may help clinicians better weigh potential benefits of medications against hepatotoxicity risk.","[('drug-induced liver injury', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate DILI', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('DILIN', 'DISEASE'), ('statins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azathioprine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('minocycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clindamycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('statins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DILIN', 'DISEASE'), ('thiazide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('angiotensin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('serotonin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metformin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('azathioprine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('minocycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('DILI', 'DISEASE'), ('hepatotoxicity', 'DISEASE')]"
39317655,2024,"BACKGROUND: Academic detailing, audit and feedback, and peer comparison have been advocated as effective ways to promote appropriateness of prescribing and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). This study explored the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention aimed at supporting the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in paediatrics. METHODS: Over the course of 7 years, all 89 paediatricians of the Local Health Authority (LHA) of Reggio Emilia (530 000 residents) were provided with scientific literature focused on antimicrobial resistance and the appropriateness of use of specific antibiotics, together with local data on antimicrobial resistance and prescribing reports comparing each paediatrician with colleagues in the same district and with local averages. Prescribing rates of specific target antibiotics/classes of antibiotics were evaluated by comparing Reggio-Emilia with the other seven LHAs of the Emilia-Romagna Region (control area), adjusting for prescriptions during a 2-year baseline period. RESULTS: A significant increase in the rate of amoxicillin prescriptions (91 more per 1000 children/year) was observed in the intervention area compared with the control area along with a significant reduction in the rate of amoxicillin+clavulanate prescriptions (70 fewer per 1000 children/year) and a significant increase in the ratio of their prescription rates. No differences were observed in cephalosporin and macrolide prescription rates and overall antibiotic prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in prescribing appropriateness were observed. This study confirms the importance of an audit and feedback approach through small group meetings supported by scientific literature, local resistance data and prescribing reports. Such approach should always be considered as part of multifaceted interventions to promote AMS.","[('AMS', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin+clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('macrolide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMS', 'DISEASE')]"
39310621,2024,"Background Due to their potential to carry a wide range of bacteria, pigeon feces may contribute to the spreading of infectious diseases in urban settings. Objective This study analyzed the presence of enteric bacteria from pigeon feces in Jeddah and their antimicrobial susceptibility and described the molecular characteristics of the carbapenem resistance genes it produced. Method Two hundred twenty-five pigeon feces specimens were collected from eight parks in Jeddah. Conventional microbiology techniques were employed to identify the isolated bacteria, and the automated Vitek2(R) system (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, Lyon, France) provided additional confirmation. Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was utilized to screen for antimicrobial resistance. Only 50 antibiotic-resistance isolates further underwent molecular diagnosis for testing groups of carbapenems-encoding genes (blaNDM, blaSIM, and blaAIM), using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Result Of the 50 antibiotic-resistant isolates, 28% (14/50) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 24% (12/50) were Enterobacter cloacae, and 48% (24/50) were Escherichia coli. Ninety percent (90%) of the isolates showed resistance to cefuroxime, 56% to gentamicin, 52% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and 100% to meropenem. NDM beta-lactamase was the most often discovered gene (26%) and was followed by AIM beta-lactamase (5%) Conclusion According to this study, there may be a chance for resistant K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, and E. coli to spread amongst several hosts within the same area. Consequently, to prevent the continued occurrence and dissemination of resistant strains among other hosts in the same location, it is essential to monitor the AMR (antimicrobial resistance) of E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae from pigeons.","[('infectious diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('carbapenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Enterobacter', 'DISEASE'), ('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NDM', 'DISEASE'), ('K. pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('K. pneumoniae', 'DISEASE')]"
39306707,2024,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), prevalent in developing regions, is a key factor in gastrointestinal diseases. Despite the common use of bismuth-based quadruple therapy, its drawbacks have prompted the search for alternatives. Recently, vonoprazan, a novel acid suppressant, has shown promise in combination with antibiotics as a dual therapy for H. pylori eradication. This study aimed to assess the therapeutic outcomes and adverse events of vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy compared to quadruple therapy. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) enrolled H. pylori-infected patients at Zhejiang Hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to dual and quadruple therapy groups. The primary endpoints were H. pylori eradication and adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 400 patients studied from April 2022 to June 2023, In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the eradication rates of H. pylori in vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy group and quadruple therapy group were 94.0% and 87.0%, respectively, p = 0.017. In the per-protocol (PP) analysis were 97.9% and 93.0%, p = 0.022. Additionally, the dual therapy group had a significantly lower incidence of adverse events (19%) compared to the quadruple therapy group (53%) (p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to document the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Salmonella species recovered from cattle carcass and abattoir personnel at Dessie, municipality abattoir, Northeast Ethiopia: METHODS: A total of 336 carcass swabs of abdomen, neck, and hind limb from cattle carcasses and 24 stool samples were collected from abattoir personnel using a systematic sampling method from February to April 2019. The collected samples were transported using Cary-Blair transport media and cultivated on Selenite cysteine F-broth, Brilliant green agar, and Xylose-lysine deoxycholate agar plates to isolate Salmonella species. Gram stain, colony morphology, and biochemical tests were performed to identify the isolated bacteria. An antimicrobial susceptibility test for Salmonella was performed using the Kirby-Bauer Disc Diffusion method. Descriptive statistics; both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed using SPSS version 25 software. P-value < 0.05 at 95% CI was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The prevalence of salmonella species was 8%(27/336) from all samples.'The prevalence of Salmonella isolates in cattle carcass and abattoir personnel was 8%(25/312) and 8.3%(2/24) respectively. The antimicrobial test showed that Salmonella species were 100% resistant to ampicillin, 59.3% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 59.3% to tetracycline, and 55.6% to amoxicillin/clavulanate. From the total antimicrobial tested bacteria, 81.5%(22/27) were resistant to three and above classes of antibiotics (drug classes). Unwashed knives, carcasses, and hands of butchers during slaughtering were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with Salmonella found in carcasses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Presented is a 10-year retrospective study of patients hospitalised at a single department in 2014-2023. 744 patients were involved. In the statistical analysis, following data was evaluated: causal microbes and their resistance to Penicillin, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate, Clindamycin and Metronidazole. RESULTS: Most frequent aetiology was odontogenic with causal tooth in socket (n = 468; 62,9%), followed by odontogenic - post extraction (n = 152; 20.4%), jaw fracture (n = 41; 5.5%), sialadenitis n = 31 (4.2%), osteonecrosis n = 22 (3.0%), oncological diagnosis in head and neck (n = 17; 2.3%), unknown (n = 10; 1.3%) and multiple factors (n = 3; 0.4%). 408 patients (54.8%) underwent extraoral abscess revision, 336 patients (45.2%) patients were treated locally without extraoral revision. In odontogenic group with tooth still present, superior CRP (m = 145.8 mg/l; SD = 117.7) and leukocyte values (m = 13.6*10(9)l; SD = 6.6) were observed in comparison to other groups. There were 698 cultivated bacteria in 362 patients. Most frequent bacteria were Streptococci (n = 162; 23.2%), Prevotella (n = 83; 11.2%) and Parvimonas (n = 65; 9.3%).

39303427,2024,"Monitoring antimicrobial use (AMU) is crucial, as it plays a key role in driving antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Animals account for a significant share of AMU, making it essential to accurately quantify AMU exposure at the species, farm, and country levels. In Pakistan, prophylactic use of antimicrobials remains common alongside therapeutic use. This study aimed to establish defined daily and course doses for both therapeutic and prophylactic use of antimicrobials in commercial broiler production in Pakistan. A list of antimicrobial products was compiled from the daily treatment records from 100 commercial broiler farms in Punjab, Pakistan. For each active substance (AS), a defined daily dose (DDD(vetPK)) was assigned for treatment, prevention or both, by averaging the recommended doses of all similar AS with the same administration route. A defined course dose (DCD(vetPK)) was calculated by multiplying the average recommended dose by the average treatment duration for each AS, based on the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). A total of 41 AS, categorized into 17 antimicrobial classes, were identified from 139 antimicrobial products. The most frequently reported AS were colistin (polymyxins) at 15.9 %, amoxicillin (aminopenicillins) at 7.5 %, neomycin (aminoglycosides) at 7.3 %, enrofloxacin (fluoroquinolones) at 6.7 %, and tylosin (macrolides) at 6.4 % of the total treatments (n = 358) reported at farms. Notably, 51 % of AS were classified as critically important for human medicine by WHO. Among AS indicated for treatment in SmPC, the defined daily doses for Pakistan (DDD(vetPK)) varied substantially from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) values (DDD(vet)), with the top deviations being Tiamulin (+147.8 %), Sulfadimidine_TMP (+111.2 %), Flumequine (+88.6 %), Spiramycin (-87.8 %), and Tylosin (-84.3 %). This study presents a list of defined daily doses and defined course doses for AMU quantification in Pakistani broilers using dose-based indicators. The observed differences between Pakistani and EMA doses, and lack of EMA doses for preventive antimicrobials, suggest using Pakistani DDD(vetPK) values to quantify antimicrobial usage in Pakistan. A huge variation in recommended doses was reported in SmPC. There is an urgent need to establish a list of approved veterinary antimicrobials used in Pakistan, along with harmonization in recommended doses and maintenance of standardized SmPC by the drug regulatory authorities.

39301407,2024,"PURPOSE: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) occasionally occurs following tooth extractions in cancer patients receiving denosumab (Dmab). However, there are currently no established guidelines for perioperative antibiotic administration during tooth extraction in these patients. The primary objective was to develop guidelines for the dose and frequency of antibiotics during tooth extraction by investigating the correlation between the current status of antibiotic administration and the development of MRONJ. METHODS: This study included 68 cancer patients receiving high-dose Dmab who had tooth extractions between 2012 and 2022 at 10 hospitals. The relationship between the way of perioperative antibiotic administration and the development of MRONJ was analyzed. A P-value < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: There was considerable variability across hospitals and surgeons regarding the type, dosage, and duration of antibiotic administration. Amoxicillin (AMPC) was the most commonly used antibiotic. Focusing exclusively on teeth extracted under AMPC administration, MRONJ developed in 21 out of 123 teeth (17.0%). No significant relationship was found between the development of MRONJ and the dosage or duration of perioperative AMPC administration. CONCLUSION: Perioperative antibiotic administration alone may not be sufficient to prevent MRONJ. Therefore, a single preoperative dose is likely adequate for effective and appropriate AMPC administration.　.","[('osteonecrosis', 'DISEASE'), ('cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('denosumab', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Dmab', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cancer', 'DISEASE'), ('Dmab', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tooth', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMPC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMPC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMPC', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AMPC', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39301370,2024,"Background Antibiotic resistance is a global health concern, yet research on the identities and proportions of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the oral microflora of healthy children remains limited. These resistant bacteria could play a role in various conditions, such as dental infections, periodontitis, or systemic infections following dental procedures, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. This study aimed to assess the prevalence, proportions, and identities of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the oral microflora of healthy children. Methodology This cross-sectional study, conducted from January to December 2023 across three tertiary care hospitals in Peshawar, Pakistan, involved 364 healthy children aged 7-13 years. Data on antibiotic use were collected via structured interviews and medical records, detailing specific antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin), including dosage, duration, and reason for use. Oral swabs were taken from various sites in the oral cavity using sterile techniques and analyzed using microbiological culture methods and polymerase chain reaction to identify antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 27.0, utilizing chi-square tests to explore associations between demographic factors and resistance patterns, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results Significant proportions of antibiotic use were found among the participants: 172 (47.25%) received penicillins, 91 (25.00%) cephalosporins, and 101 (27.75%) macrolides, with associated side effects including gastrointestinal disorders and allergic responses. Age and gender differences were observed in antibiotic resistance proportions: among 7-9-year-olds, resistance to penicillins was 44 (18.33%), to cephalosporins 29 (12.08%), and to macrolides 33 (13.75%). In contrast, among 10-13-year-olds, these proportions increased to 55 (22.92%), 36 (15.00%), and 43 (17.92%), respectively. Male participants exhibited resistance to cephalosporins at a proportion of 24 (10.00%), to macrolides 45 (18.75%), and to penicillin 46 (19.17%), while female participants showed proportions of 53 (22.08%), 41 (17.08%), and 31 (12.92%), respectively. Among oral swab locations, the buccal mucosa had the highest resistance proportions: 35 (14.58%) to penicillins, 27 (11.25%) to cephalosporins, and 33 (13.92%) to macrolides. Specific bacterial species showed distinct resistance patterns, with notable proportions observed in Staphylococcus aureus (n=18; 50.00%, n=12; 33.33%, and n=6; 16.67%, respectively), Escherichia coli (n=16; 40.00%, n=10; 25.00%, and n=14; 35.00%, respectively), Enterococcus faecalis (n=29; 45.31%, n=14; 21.88%, and n=21; 32.81%, respectively), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=19; 36.54%, n=13; 25.00%, and n=20; 38.46%, respectively). Conclusions This study focused on healthy children aged 7-13 years in Peshawar, Pakistan, to assess the prevalence and types of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in their oral microbiota. The findings highlight resistance patterns by age, gender, and bacterial species. However, the regional context may limit the generalizability of these results.

39302420,2025,"Previous research from our group revealed a strong association between daily defined dose (DDD)-costs and -prescriptions of antibacterial drugs in Germany ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38842562/ ; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39042156/ ). These data indicate that low costs are major driver of high prescription numbers. This study examines the relationship between bacterial resistance and DDD-prescriptions of antibacterial drugs using data from the Arzneiverordnungsreport (AVR) from 2008 to 2022 and the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS) statistics provided by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). We hypothesized that semi-rational or irrational prescribing behavior of antibacterial drugs is evident in Germany, i.e., prescriptions are driven to a greater extents by low DDD-costs than bacterial resistance. A bivariate correlation analysis was performed to test these models. Our data point to irrational prescribing behavior for amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, doxycycline, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin. For amoxicillin clavulanic acid and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, data point to semi-rational prescribing. For no antibacterial drug, a model pointing to rational drug prescribing was found. In conclusion, our study shows that DDD-costs exert a more significant influence on DDD-prescriptions than bacterial resistance, indicating that economic factors, rather than scientific evidence, primarily drive antibacterial drug prescriptions in outpatient settings in Germany. It will be important to conduct similar studies on the prescription of antibacterial drugs in other countries.

39296834,2024,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and antibacterial resistance (ABR) are important public health problems, but they are not well-studied among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) globally, especially in low-income countries. Therefore, it is important to regularly measure the extent of UTIs and ABR in the most susceptible populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of UTIs, associated factors, bacterial causal agents, and their antibiotic susceptibility profile among PLHIV in central Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit 688 PLHIV by a simple random sampling method. Background information was gathered through interviews, while clinical information was gathered from recent information sheets of patient charts using organized, pretested, and validated study tools. Midstream urine was collected aseptically and transported to the Microbiology Laboratory of Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology within 4 h of collection, maintaining its cold chain. Standard conventional microbial culture methods and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry were used to identify the bacterial isolates at the species level. Kirby Bauer's disk diffusion method was used to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile of the bacterial isolates based on the interpretation guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. Logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with the occurrence of UTIs among PLHIV attending selected hospitals in Addis Ababa, and Adama. RESULTS: Out of 688 PLHIVs involved in the current study, 144 (20.9%) were positive for UTIs, whereas the majority were asymptomatic for UTIs. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, only HIV RNA >/= 200 copies/ml [AOR = 12.24 (95% CI, 3.24, 46.20), p < 0.01] and being symptomatic for UTIs during the study period [AOR = 11.57 (95% CI, 5.83, 22.97), p < 0.01] were associated with the occurrence of UTIs. The dominant bacterial species isolated were Escherichia coli (E. coli; n = 65; 43%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis; n = 16; 10.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae; n = 11; 7.3%). Over half of the E. coli isolates were resistant to antibiotics such as gentamicin (GM; n = 44; 67.7%), amikacin (AN; n = 46; 70.8%), nalidixic acid (NA; n = 42; 64.6%), ciprofloxacin (CIP; n = 40; 61.5%), and azithromycin (AZM; n = 45; 69.2%). All of the K. pneumoniae isolates (n = 11; 100%), (n = 6; 54.5%), and (n = 7; 63.6%) were resistant to [amoxicillin as well as amoxicillin + clavulanic acid], ceftriaxone, and sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim, respectively. All the Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, which implies methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of UTIs and antibiotic resistance revealed in the current study needs public health interventions such as educating the population about preventive measures and the importance of early treatment of UTIs.

39296531,2024,"PURPOSE: Immunizations have long been pivotal in preventing diseases like HZ (herpes zoster), caused by VZV (varicella zoster virus). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the RZV (recombinant zoster vaccine) compared to the ZVL (zoster vaccine live) and to report rare adverse events following RZV administration. OBSERVATION: Herein, we report an unusual case of a 59-year-old man who developed a V1-limited rash with a positive HZ PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test following administration of RZV in the United States. CONCLUSION: The development of RZV has significantly improved the prevention of HZ compared to ZVL. Nevertheless, rare adverse events, such as dermatomal reactions, underscore the importance of ongoing monitoring and research into the immunomodulatory effects of RZV. Physicians should continue to administer the RZV to patients but be cognizant that reactivation may rarely subsequently occur.

39293772,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Keverprazan is a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker. The advantages of keverprazan as a potent acid suppressor in Helicobacter pylori eradication have not yet been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of keverprazan as a component of bismuth quadruple therapy in H. pylori treatment. METHODS: Adult patients with H. pylori infection were enrolled and randomised to take keverprazan (KEV group)- or esomeprazole (ESO group)-quadruple therapy. The regimens contained keverprazan 20 mg or esomeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg and bismuth potassium citrate 240 mg and were administered twice daily for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the H. pylori eradication rate at 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: The full analysis set showed that the H. pylori eradication rates were 87.8% (252/287) and 82.52% (236/286) for the KEV and ESO groups, respectively (difference: 5.29%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.55-11.18). Keverprazan was superior to esomeprazole in terms of eradication rate in the per protocol set (P=0.0382). The eradication rates for patients resistant or non-resistant to clarithromycin were both numerically higher in the KEV group than the ESO group (83.45% vs. 76.98% for clarithromycin-resistance; 92.31% vs. 88.16% for clarithromycin-non-resistance). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the KEV and ESO groups (76.31% vs. 77.62%), with most adverse events (>90%) being mild in severity. No TEAEs led to death in either group.

39290938,2024,"BACKGROUND: Intensive medical care units (IMCUs) usually admit patients who are in critical medical need and require the utmost attention of healthcare professionals, along with the best treatment options available. These patients are prone to infections and require various antibiotics for the treatment. Varying costs of antibiotics, variable dosage forms, and antibiotic resistance cause an economic burden on patients Methodology: This study was designed and conducted prospectively to evaluate the prescribing pattern of antibiotics at the IMCU in a tertiary care hospital. A total of 102 patients were included in the study based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, and the collected data was tabulated in an Excel sheet and analyzed using Prism GraphPad software. Data were presented as numbers and percentages. RESULTS: Most of the patients were in the age group of 41-50 years. The number of male patients was slightly more than that of female patients. The majority of the patients admitted to the IMCU had acute pulmonary edema and cerebrovascular accidents. Most antibiotics were prescribed empirically and administered parenterally, of which Amoxicillin + Potassium clavulanate was the most commonly used antibiotic. Tigecycline had the highest daily defined dose per 100 bed days value, and injection Sulbactam + Cefoperazone was the costliest of all antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic therapy used in the IMCU consisting of Sulbactam + Cefoperazone was found to be costlier, and Amoxicillin + Potassium clavulanate were the commonly prescribed antibiotics among the other prescribed antibiotics. The average cost of antibiotics was found to be higher, which increased the economic healthcare burden for patients and their families.","[('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('acute pulmonary edema', 'DISEASE'), ('cerebrovascular accidents', 'DISEASE'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Potassium clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Tigecycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Sulbactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Cefoperazone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Sulbactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Cefoperazone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Potassium clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39290332,2024,"BACKGROUND: Clarithromycin plays an important role in eradicating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) through quadruple therapy. However, there is limited research on whether different forms of clarithromycin dosage have similar efficacies against H. pylori. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different forms of clarithromycin dosage in bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for eradicating H. pylori. DESIGN: A single-center retrospective analysis comparing the efficacy of different forms of clarithromycin dosage in eradicating H. pylori. METHODS: An analysis was conducted on patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection through the (13)C-urea breath test (13C-UBT) at Henan Provincial People's Hospital, China from 2020 to 2022 who were treated with either a dispersible or sustained-release clarithromycin tablet (500 mg each), alongside amoxicillin (1000 mg), a standard dose of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and bismuth citrate (220 mg), administered twice daily as part of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. Treatment efficacy was assessed using 13C-UBT at least 4 weeks after treatment completion. The H. pylori eradication rate was the primary outcome of this study, and factors influencing it were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 2094 screened patients, 307 with H. pylori infection (mean age, 41.8 +/- 0.7 years; 43% men) received bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. Univariate analysis of the dispersible and sustained-release tablet groups revealed a lower eradication rate with the sustained-release tablet compared with the dispersible clarithromycin tablet regimen (75.26% (73/97) vs 95.26% (200/210), respectively; p < 0.05). Other factors, such as smoking, age, and PPI type, were not significantly associated with the cure rate. Multivariate analysis identified the form of clarithromycin dosage (dispersible vs sustained-release) to be an independent risk factor for eradication failure using the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (odds ratio = 0.145, 95% confidence interval: (0.065-0.323); p < 0.05).

39290131,2025,"AIMS: The current treatment for Buruli ulcer is based on empirical evidence of efficacy. However, there is an opportunity for shortening its duration and improving response rates. Evolving understanding of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships provides the basis for a stronger dose rationale for antibiotics. In conjunction with modelling and simulation, it is possible to identify dosing regimens with the highest probability of target attainment (PTA). This investigation aims to: (i) assess the dose rationale for a new combination therapy including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMX/CLV) currently in clinical trials; and (ii) compare its performance with alternative dosing regimens including rifampicin, clarithromycin and AMX/CLV. METHODS: In vitro estimates of the minimum inhibitory (MIC) concentration were selected as a measure of the antibacterial activity of different drug combinations. Clinical trial simulations were used to characterize the concentration vs. time profiles of rifampicin, clarithromycin and amoxicillin in a virtual cohort of adult and paediatric patients, considering the effect of baseline covariates on disposition parameters and interindividual variability in exposure. The PTA of each regimen was then assessed using different thresholds of the time above MIC. RESULTS: A weight-banded dosing regimen including 150-600 mg rifampicin once daily, 250-1000 mg clarithromycin and AMX/CLV 22.5 mg/kg /1000 mg twice daily ensures higher PTA than the standard of care with AMX/CLV 45 mg/kg/2000 mg once daily. CONCLUSION: The higher PTA values support the proposed 4-drug combination (rifampicin, clarithromycin, AMX/CLV) currently under clinical investigation.

This wound dressing exhibited a 3D porous structure for soft-tissue-engineering application, including high porosity (84.2%), swelling ratio (1513%), tensile strength (1.79 MPA), and flexibility. With the inhibition zones of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) being 1.96 and4.58 cm, respectively, this wound dressing demonstrated good antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. More importantly, wound healing assay in vivo indicates that SCP-AMX could inhibit wound infection, promote collagen deposition, reduce inflammation, and accelerate granulation tissue and wound healing.

A total of 172 samples consisting of 38 brands of PIF available in the Lagos metropolis were sampled, suspended in water (10 g in 100 mL), and bacteria strains were isolated using combinational enrichment and selective culture techniques. Pure bacterial strains were characterized and identified based on their physiology and 16S rRNA gene sequence homology. While 85 bacterial strains were isolated from the enriched culture system, 20 strains were selectively isolated based on tolerance to sodium deoxycholate. Approximately 13% of the selected bacteria were identified as Cronobacter spp., exhibiting virulence traits including extracellular protease production, coagulation and proteolysis of casein, haem-agglutination, and beta-haemolysis of human blood.

39286701,2024,"Aim and objective Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a frequent complication of diabetes mellitus, impacting more than one in 10 diabetic patients, with roughly half of these ulcers progressing to infection. Existing literature indicates that these infections are predominantly polymicrobial, with gram-positive isolates being the most common. This microbial profile informs the empiric antibiotic strategies employed in first-world countries, often including highly potent nephrotoxic antibiotics. This retrospective cohort study aims to assess the microbial profile and antibiotic treatment practices in patients with infected DFUs at Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport Academic Medical Center in Shreveport, Louisiana, United States. Materials and methods A total of 115 patients diagnosed with infected DFUs were included in the study. Patient records were reviewed to identify bacterial pathogens cultured from foot wounds, antibiotic treatment regimens administered, and the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Results The study found a predominance of gram-negative isolates (199; 59.4%), facultative anaerobes (246; 73.4%), and polymicrobial infections (67; 78.8%) in infected DFUs. Vancomycin was administered to 95 patients (82.6%), with only a small number subsequently testing positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Combination therapy with vancomycin and Zosyn was given to 71 patients (61.7%), which increased the potential risk of antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity. AKI was prevalent, affecting 58 patients (50.4%). Conclusions This study highlights a discrepancy between the microbial profile of infected DFUs and empiric antibiotic treatment practices at Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport Academic Medical Center. The predominance of gram-negative bacteria underscores the need for a polymicrobial, gram-negative-focused empiric treatment approach. Alternative antibiotics with broad-spectrum coverage and minimal nephrotoxicity, such as ceftriaxone, clindamycin, metronidazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and linezolid, should be considered.

39285296,2024,"BACKGROUND: Despite the worldwide increasing incidence of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections reported since December 2022, data on noninvasive GAS (nGAS) infections in the post COVID-19 era are limited. By a self-reported survey performed in an outpatient setting, we investigated the number and clinical features of GAS infections, the diagnostic work-up and the type of treatment utilized. In addition, the rate of influenza vaccination was evaluated. METHODS: In June 2023 family pediatricians involved in the study sent the survey to parents of patients aged 0-16 years. The survey included questions on GAS infections that occurred from January 1 to May 31, 2023. RESULTS: Among 3580 children, 20.3% had a GAS infection (0,8% < 1 year, 16,4% 1-3 years, 42,3% 3-6 years, 26,5% 6-9 years, 11,4%, 9-12 years, and 2,6% 12-16 years). Symptoms reported were sore throat (76.9%), fever (75.2%), tonsillar exudate (25.2%), lymphadenopathy (21.8%), and scarlet fever (14.7%). A single patient was hospitalized due to GAS meningitis. Twenty four percent of children had more than one GAS infection. In this group, frequencies of symptoms reported in the first and in the following infection were similar, except for fever and scarlet fever which were less frequent during relapses. GAS was identified by rapid antigen detection test in 81.0% of children. Eighty-nine per cent of children were treated with antibiotics, mostly amoxicillin/clavulanate (40.4%) and amoxicillin (39.4%). Thirty four percent of children received influenza vaccine. No difference was observed among immunized and not immunized regarding the number and characteristics of GAS infection. CONCLUSIONS: We reported a certain prevalence of nGAS infections in children, mainly those aged 3-6 years age, who were mostly characterized by a low score of symptoms, and in most of the cases diagnosed and treated using a microbiological test as confirmatory tool. In this new clinical setting, a national study would be useful to reach more significant data for the definition of a correct diagnosis and clinical management of nGAS infections in children.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old presented to the emergency department with worsening upper respiratory infectious (URI) symptoms and facial swelling, cough, throat pain, and emesis. The patient had traveled to Switzerland and received amoxicillin for strep throat 6 weeks before this hospitalization. Physical examination revealed nasal purulence, allodynia over the right side of the face without overlying erythema, and oropharyngeal exudate. CT scan revealed left-sided predominate sinusitis and right external jugular vein thrombosis. Blood cultures confirmed the presence of group A streptococcus infection. Treatment included IV antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), IV steroids, and anticoagulation. Follow-up imaging demonstrated improvement in thrombosis, cellulitis, and sinus disease. The patient was discharged on antibiotics for 6 weeks and anticoagulation for 10 weeks. Follow-up imaging at 6 months revealed no EJT, and medications were discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: EJT is a rare condition, and to our knowledge, no reports of EJT with sinusitis most pronounced on the contralateral side have been published. Physicians will benefit from noting clinical signs of EJT such as facial edema, headache, erythema, and palpable neck mass, especially if these symptoms occur with URI symptoms refractory to treatment.

Product-level medicine emission data is limited, hindering mitigation efforts. To address this, we created Medicine Carbon Footprint (MCF) Classifier, to estimate, standardize, stratify and visualize medicine carbon footprints. METHODS: We used molecular weight and chemical structure to estimate the process mass intensity and global warming potential of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in small molecule medicines. This allowed us to estimate medicine carbon footprints per dose, which we categorized into MCF Ratings, accessible via a searchable web application, MCF Formulary. We performed comparison and sensitivity analyses to validate the ratings, and stratification analyses by therapeutic indication to identify priority areas for emission reduction interventions. RESULTS: We generated standardized medicine carbon footprints for 2214 products, with 38% rated LOW, 35% MEDIUM, 25% HIGH and 2% VERY HIGH. These products represented 2.2 billion NHS England prescribed doses in January 2023, with a total footprint of 140 000 tonnes CO(2)e, equivalent to the monthly emissions of 940 000 cars. Notably, three antibiotics-amoxicillin, flucloxacillin and penicillin V-contributed 15% of emissions. We estimate that implementing the recommended 20% antibiotic prescription reduction could save 4200 tonnes CO(2)e per month, equivalent to removing 29 000 cars.

39284094,2024,"INTRODUCTION: Actinomycosis is a rare, chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces species with a reported incidence of 1 in 300 000. Actinomycosis has variable presentations and is commonly mistaken for malignancy and other infections, leading to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Actinomyces is a commensal bacteria found in the mouth, gut, and genitourinary tract. Actinomycosis tends to take advantage of anatomical defects for contiguous spread and can cause fistulas, sinus tracts, abscesses, and intrauterine device-associated infections. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old White male with known dental caries came to a primary care clinic 2 days after noticing a painless, nonbleeding mass eroding from his hard palate. After a tissue biopsy of the mass showed a diagnosis of actinomycosis and advanced imaging showed no intracranial involvement, he was treated with a 6-month course of antibiotics, including oral amoxicillin, oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, and intravenous ertapenem. DISCUSSION: There are several case reports of actinomycosis with variable presentations, such as cutaneous nodules and sinus tracts. These cases frequently are associated with dental infections and procedures, trauma, oral surgery, or prior head and neck radiation. The condition is often mistaken for other infections or malignancy, which can delay appropriate treatment and increase the risk of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Actinomycosis is a rare bacterial infection with variable presentations occurring throughout the body. This patient responded well to a prolonged course of intravenous and oral antibiotics and had complete healing of his hard palate defect.

A total of 120 chicken samples were collected from different poultry farms. Conventional culture and molecular detection methods were used for identification of bacterial isolates from the collected samples followed by antibiotic susceptibility test through the disc diffusion method, finally antibiotic resistant genes were detected by PCR. E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in meat, egg and faecal samples. Antimicrobial susceptibility results revealed isolates from faeces were 100 % resistant to amoxicillin, while all S. aureus and Salmonella sp. from faeces were resistant to doxycycline, tetracycline and erythromycin. Salmonella spp. isolates from eggs indicated 100 % resistance to erythromycin, amoxycillin, while E. coli were 100 % resistant to erythromycin.

METHOD: We report the synthesis of AgNPs and their amoxicillin conjugates (Ag-amoxi) using Micromeria biflora crude flavonoid extracts. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized NPs and Ag-amoxi conjugates were systematically evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopic techniques. RESULTS: The average sizes of AgNPs and Ag-amoxi conjugates were 45 and 62 nm, respectively. We have also explored the antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties of the AgNPs and Ag-amoxi conjugates through in vivo and in vitro analysis. The Ag-amoxi conjugates showed better antibacterial potential against Streptococcus Pneumoniae (S.P), Staphylococcus aureus (S.A), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.A), and Methicillin resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain both the drug and AgNPs. Similarly, in vivo anti-inflammatory studies revealed that both Ag-amoxi (68 %) and AgNPs (64 %) had strong anti-inflammatory effects, with (***p < 0.001) significance at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1) body weight as compared to standard, amoxicillin (45 %), and flavonoids extract (48 %) at a dose of 100 mg kg(-1). The findings of the antinociceptive activities (writhing and hot plate tests) demonstrated that the Ag-amoxi conjugates produced fewer writhing (15 in 20 s) and a shorter latency time of 22 s as compared to vehicle-treated (tramadol) animals, amoxicillin, and P.E at much lower doses. In vitro antioxidant studies revealed that the Ag-amoxi conjugate has the potential to be used as an antioxidant with an IC(50) value of 43.58, compared with AgNPs (46.34), amoxicillin (58.17), compared to the standard of ascorbic acid (34.14). CONCLUSION: These results reveals that these biologically inspired AgNPs and Ag-amoxi conjugate could be used to improve antibiotic efficiency and could play a critical role in addressing the multidrug resistance problem in coming years.","[('AgNPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('NPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AgNPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AgNPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'DISEASE'), ('AgNPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('writhing', 'DISEASE'), ('tramadol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AgNPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ascorbic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AgNPs', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39281346,2024,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the food chain remains a global public health concern for both humans and animals. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, resistance profiles, and clonal relatedness of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases- producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-Ec) isolated from slaughtered pigs and slaughterhouse workers in Yaounde, Cameroon. A cross-sectional study was conducted over four months, from February to May 2023 in two selected pig's slaughterhouse markets in Yaounde. Rectal swabs were collected from 375 pigs at four time points and pooled per three according to gender, origin, and abattoirs leading to 125 pooled samples. Seven faecal samples from 60 contacted exposed workers were collected. Samples were cultured on CHROMagar ESBL medium, dark pink to reddish colonies were considered E. coli. Resistance genes including bla (CTX-M), bla (SHV) and bla (TEM) were detected using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) while ERIC-PCR was used to assess the genetic relatedness between isolates. The prevalence of ESBL-Ec was elevated among exposed workers (71.4 %; n = 5/7) and pigs (70.4 %; n = 88/125). Overall, ESBL-Ec exhibited high resistance to cefuroxime (100 %, n = 105/105), cefotaxime (100 %, n = 105/105), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (98.1 %, n = 103/105), cefixime (92.4 %, n = 97/105), tetracycline (86.7 %, n = 91/105) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (81.9 %, n = 86/105). However, these isolates showed good susceptibility to gentamicin (3.8 %, n = 4/105), chloramphenicol (8.6 %, n = 9/105), and fosfomycin (14.3 %, n = 15/105). All human isolates and 75.8 % (n = 75/99) of pig isolates were multi-drug resistant. The bla (CTX-M) was the most prevalent resistance gene among exposed workers (100 %, n = 6/6) and pigs (80.8 %, n = 80/99) followed by bla (TEM) (33.3 % each). High clonal relatedness of ESBL-Ec strains was observed among pig and human isolates across slaughterhouses. This study showed that the gastrointestinal tract of pigs might be an important reservoir of MDR and ESBL-Ec in Yaounde, Cameroon and these resistant bacteria might be circulating between sources, especially humans. Heightening awareness on appropriate antibiotic use in humans and animals as well as implementing stringent biosecurity and food safety measures are imperative to prevent the emergence and spread of AMR in the country.","[('cefuroxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefixime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chloramphenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fosfomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('MDR', 'DISEASE')]"
39280464,2024,"Lemierre's syndrome primarily affects healthy adolescents and young adults as a complication of oropharyngeal infection, most commonly pharyngitis or peritonsillar abscess. Fusobacterium necrophorum is the principal pathogen, and the infection presents with classic symptoms including fever, sore throat, and neck tenderness. However, atypical presentations can pose diagnostic challenges. This report discusses a patient in her early 60s, contrary to the typical demographic, who presented with a one-week history of varied symptoms including sore throat, pleuritic chest pain, and haemoptysis. Examination revealed mild neck tenderness and lung crepitations. Laboratory tests indicated leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Imaging revealed pulmonary infiltrates with cavitation. F. necrophorum was detected in blood culture, promoting a CT scan of the neck, which confirmed soft tissue swelling and a small peritonsillar collection, leading to the diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome. The classical feature of jugular vein thrombus was absent, further underscoring the atypical nature of this case. The patient received immediate initiation of intravenous antibiotics, piperacillin/tazobactam, followed by meropenem. This was complemented by a carefully tailored 21-day intravenous course, followed by an eight-week regimen of oral antibiotics consisting of amoxicillin and metronidazole. The patient demonstrated significant clinical improvement in pulmonary complications. Follow-up imaging showed minor residual changes, and the patient remained asymptomatic. Lemierre's syndrome presents a diagnostic challenge due to diverse clinical manifestations. Key diagnostic markers include deep neck infections, septicemia, and metastatic infections. Timely utilization of diagnostic tools, such as blood cultures and imaging, aid in confirmation. Early diagnosis is crucial for prompt treatment and prevention of complications.

39277787,2024,"BACKGROUND Necrotizing fasciitis is an aggressive type of skin and soft tissue infection that results in necrosis of subcutaneous tissues, including muscle and fascia. Mixed bacteria, including gas-forming organisms, are usually identified. This report describes a 55-year-old male diabetic patient with herpes zoster involving the thoracic dermatomes complicated by skin infection, necrotizing fasciitis, chest wall abscess, and sepsis. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old man with diabetes mellitus presented with thoracic herpes zoster, initially treated with acyclovir and topical agents. He developed swelling, pain, and fever over the left chest, which was unresponsive to topical treatment. Investigations revealed elevated white blood cells and gas on chest X-ray. Computed tomography confirmed a 13x6x11-cm abscess with gas between the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscles, suggesting necrosis. He received intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and metronidazole and underwent urgent surgical drainage, yielding 200 mL of pus. Cultures identified antibiotic-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens. Histopathology confirmed necrotizing tissue with acute bacterial inflammation. He was treated postoperatively with dressings and vacuum-assisted closure, followed by sutures, and was discharged in good condition after 16 days. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the aggressive nature and potential complications of necrotizing soft tissue infections in patients with diabetes mellitus and herpes zoster. Prompt recognition, early intervention with appropriate antibiotics, and surgical drainage are crucial in managing such infections effectively. The successful use of vacuum-assisted closure therapy underscores its role in facilitating wound healing after debridement.

However, little is known about how antibiotic prescription practices following a diagnosis of ARS compare to guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Otolaryngology in 2015. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of ARS and the corresponding antibiotic prescribing practices by physicians and compare to published guidelines. METHODS: Using the TriNetX Live database, we identified all patients diagnosed with ARS using the ICD10 code J01 between April 2015 and December 2022 across the state of Tennessee. After investigating the demographics of this cohort, we compared the first prescribed antibiotic within one day of ARS diagnosis to published guidelines. Antibiotics were grouped into their respective classes. RESULTS: Of 81 310 patients diagnosed with ARS identified in the specified time frame, 66% were Female, 49% were African American, 44% were White, and the mean age was 47 +/- 20 years. The six most common initial antibiotics prescribed for ARS were erythromycins/macrolides [14 609 (25.8%)], amoxicillin/clavulanate [14 322 (25.3%)], amoxicillin [9300 (16.4%)], third generation cephalosporins [7733 (13.6%)], quinolones [3648 (6.4%)] and tetracyclines [2235 (3.9%)]. Of this cohort, 56 719 patients (69.8%) of patients were prescribed an antibiotic within one day of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Despite published guidelines recommending amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid as first-line treatment for ARS, only 42.2% of prescribed antibiotics followed this guideline in our cohort. While accounting for patients with penicillin allergy, the second-most represented antibiotics were erythromycins/macrolides, which are specifically recommended against due to high rates of S. Pneumoniae resistance. Our results suggest that further investigation into the causes of erythromycin/macrolide prescriptions as first line treatment for ARS and practices at other institutions should be conducted. In addition, building awareness around published ARS guidelines for physicians may be useful in improving antibiotic stewardship in treatment of ARS.","[('Acute rhinosinusitis', 'DISEASE'), ('ARS', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cephalosporins', 'CHEMICAL'), ('quinolones', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracyclines', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL')]"

39274542,2024,"Introduction: Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are highly prevalent health issues among women, significantly impacting their quality of life. Urethral pain or urethritis can arise from infectious or non-infectious origins. The presence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the urogenital tract has been associated with high-risk sexual behaviors, but its presence in the female urethra without such behaviors has not been thoroughly investigated. Objectives: The study aims to determine the presence of HPV in the urethra of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) and concomitant urethral syndrome and to compare the clinical and microbiological characteristics of women with and without urethral HPV, specifically focusing on those without high-risk sexual behaviors. Methods: This prospective multicenter study included 138 women over 18 years old with rUTIs and concomitant urethral pain syndrome. High-risk sexual behaviors, sexually transmitted infections, and vaginitis were set as exclusion criteria. Participants were divided into two groups: NHPV (n = 72) with no urethral HPV and HPV (n = 66) with urethral HPV presence. Variables analyzed included age, body mass index (BMI), follow-up duration, comorbidities, treatments, toxic habits, surgical history, main symptoms, urine sediment findings, and cultures from urine and vaginal exudate. HPV genotyping was also performed. Descriptive statistics were used, along with Student's t-test, Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, ANOVA, and multivariate cluster analysis. Results: The NHPV group was older on average (48.75 years) compared to the HPV group (39.09 years). The HPV group had a longer follow-up period (2634 days vs. 1975 days in NHPV). Urinary incontinence was significantly more common in NHPV (63.89%) compared to HPV (18.18%) (p = 0.001). HPV-positive women had a higher prevalence of verrucous lesions in the vaginal introitus (64% vs. 8% in NHPV). Additionally, the HPV group showed higher rates of pyuria (27.27%), vaginal Candida albicans (36.26%), and positive urine cultures for Escherichia coli (47.83%), Enterococcus faecalis (36.36%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (21.74%). No significant differences were observed between the groups concerning BMI, smoking habits, diabetes, or the main symptom at consultation. The most common HPV genotypes identified were G35, G42, and G66 (each 27%). Multivariate analysis revealed that sensitivity to nitrofurantoin was the most significant variable in the HPV group (importance of 0.96), followed by fosfomycin (0.79), trimethoprim (0.79), and amoxicillin (0.71). Conclusions: HPV was present in the urethra of 47.8% of women with rUTIs and concomitant urethral syndrome who did not exhibit high-risk sexual behaviors. These women were younger and had a longer duration of symptoms compared to those without urethral HPV. The identification of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae was more common in the HPV group. The sensitivity of bacteria to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin is crucial for the clinical management of these patients. The presence of urethral HPV should be considered in the evaluation and treatment of women with rUTIs and urethral syndrome.","[('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('Urethral pain', 'DISEASE'), ('urethritis', 'DISEASE'), ('infectious or non-infectious', 'DISEASE'), ('sexual behaviors', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('urethral syndrome', 'DISEASE'), ('sexual behaviors', 'DISEASE'), ('urethral pain syndrome', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('vaginitis', 'DISEASE'), ('Urinary incontinence', 'DISEASE'), ('verrucous lesions', 'DISEASE'), ('pyuria', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('diabetes', 'DISEASE'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fosfomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('urethral syndrome', 'DISEASE'), ('pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('fosfomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rUTIs and urethral syndrome', 'DISEASE')]"
39274523,2024,"Objective: An increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is observed worldwide, partly due to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which are ineffective in certain population subgroups. This negatively impacts both the healthcare system and patients. Our study aimed to investigate the current AMR profiles for the most commonly used antibiotics in treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by gram-negative bacteria (GNB) across different age and gender subpopulations. By doing so, we provide valuable information for doctors managing prophylactic and empiric therapeutic treatments. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analysed over 650,000 urine cultures collected in the Microbiology Department of a referral university hospital in Southern England from January 2014 to December 2022. A population-based analysis for subgroups was performed to rule out differences in AMR patterns. Our report was recorded at UHS as an internal audit (UHS7670). Results: 146,867 cultures were found positive for GNB growth. Nitrofurantoin showed the best sensitivity patterns for all age subgroups (0.93% for patients aged </= 18; 1.22% for patients aged 19-40; 2.17% for patients aged 40-60; and 3.48% for patients aged > 60), regardless of gender (male: 6.37%, female: 2.59%). Ampicillin/amoxicillin and trimethoprim showed a poor AMR profile for all age groups (>55% and >28%, respectively) and genders (>60% and >28%, respectively). All the other tested antibiotics (cefalexin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav, gentamicin) showed an overall good profile for GNB resistance across all subgroups. For all antibiotics except trimethoprim, the risk of developing AMR was significantly higher in the male population. We also found that people aged over 60 had a higher risk of AMR compared to the other age groups for all antibiotics, with the exception of cefotaxime and co-amoxiclav. Conclusions: With an overall rise in resistance patterns for GNB-related UTIs, certain antibiotics-particularly ampicillin/amoxicillin and trimethoprim-now exhibit very poor sensitivity profiles. However, antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin and gentamicin remain excellent options for empirically treating UTIs. It is important to note that AMR can vary across different populations, with higher resistance often found in elderly and male patients. Clinicians must stay informed about current guidelines and research to provide the best treatment options while minimizing the risk of further AMR development.","[('urinary tract infections', 'DISEASE'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('UHS', 'DISEASE'), ('Nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefalexin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ciprofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-amoxiclav', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-amoxiclav', 'CHEMICAL'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE'), ('ampicillin/amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nitrofurantoin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('gentamicin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('UTIs', 'DISEASE')]"

Investigations are in progress globally to eliminate AMX and other related pollutants using several methods that include adsorption, photolysis, photocatalytic degradation, photoelectrocatalytic degradation, and electrochemical conversion. AMX can be eliminated efficiently from the environment using photodegradation, either by photolysis or a photocatalytic process. Several types of semiconductor NMs have been used to eliminate AMX and other related drugs present in wastewater. This review spans the photodegradation studies conducted during the years 2018-2024 to degrade and eliminate AMX in aquatic systems. Several studies have been reported to eliminate AMX from different water streams. These studies are categorized into TiO(2)-containing and non-TiO(2)-based catalysts for better comparison. A section on photolysis is also included, showing the use of UV alone or with H(2)O(2) or PS without using any nanomaterial. A tabulated summary of both types of catalysts showing the catalysts, reaction conditions, and degradation efficiency is presented. Researchers have used a variety of reaction conditions that include radiation types (UV, solar, and visible), pH of the solution, concentration of AMX, number of nanomaterials, presence of other additives and activators such as H(2)O(2) as oxidant, and the influence of different salts like NaCl and CaCl(2) on the photodegradation efficiency. TiO(2) was the best nanomaterial found that achieved the highest degradation of AMX in ultraviolet irradiation. TiO(2) doped with other nanomaterials showed very good performance under visible light. WO(3) was also used by several investigators and found quite effective for AMX degradation. Other metal oxides used for AMX elimination were derived from molybdenum, zinc, manganese, copper, cerium, silver, etc. Some researchers have used UV and/or visible irradiation or sunlight, without using solid catalysts, in the presence of oxidants such as H(2)O(2).

Also, they have antibacterial activity increased after formation of nanocomposite with nano-chitosan (SeNPs/NCh) against several pathogens. The antibacterial activity (expressed as a diameter of the inhibitory zone) averaged between 2.1 and 4.3, 2.7 and 4.8 cm for SeNPs and SeNPs/NCh, respectively compared with 1.1 to 1.8 cm for Amoxicillin. The produced nanoselenium/chitosan was used as a biofilter to remove mercury (Hg) and AgNPs as model chemicals with serious toxicity and potential pollutant for water bodies in many industries. The new SeNPs/NCh biofilter has proven highly effective in individually removing mercury and AgNPs from their synthetic wastewaters, with an efficiency of up to 99%. Moreover, the removal efficiency of AgNPs stabilized at 99% after treating them with the syringe filter-Se nanocomposite for 4 cycles of treatment (5 min each).","[('Selenium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('salt', 'CHEMICAL'), ('selenium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('selenium', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nanoform', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Bacillus pumilus', 'DISEASE'), ('glucose', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbon', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AgNPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('toxicity', 'DISEASE'), ('AgNPs', 'CHEMICAL'), ('AgNPs', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39271014,2024,"OBJECTIVES: The spread of carbapenem-resistant bacteria (CRB), and especially carbapenemase-producing CRB, is a global public health threat. Among them, Aeromonas species are of increasing concern because these emerging opportunistic pathogens are widespread in the environment and have increasingly been found to be resistant to carbapenems. The aim of this study was to investigate the genome and carbapenem-resistance determinants of Aeromonas veronii SS-M2-3, a highly carbapenem-resistant, carbapenemase-producing, river isolate from California (U.S.). METHODS: We first used disk diffusion assays to characterize the susceptibility profile to carbapenems and other antibiotics of A. veronii SS-M2-3. We next used whole-genome sequencing using the Illumina platform and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the resistome of this isolate and identify its carbapenemase genes. RESULTS: A. veronii SS-M2-3 was resistant to all carbapenems tested and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, whereas it was sensitive to cefotaxime and all non-beta-lactam antibiotics tested. Whole genome sequencing of this isolate revealed a complex resistome that included multidrug efflux pump genes and three chromosomal beta-lactamase genes. These three genes encoded for highly conserved variants (82% to 97% amino acid identity) of the ChpA3 subclass B2 metallo-carbapenemase, OXA-12 class D carbapenemase and the FOX-2 class C beta-lactamase. This is the first report of an environmental A. veronni isolate from the U.S. co-harbouring two carbapenemase genes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that natural aquatic environments in the U.S. represent an underappreciated reservoir of carbapenem-resistant Aeromonas veronii isolates that can carry multiple carbapenemase genes.","[('CRB', 'DISEASE'), ('CRB', 'DISEASE'), ('A. veronii SS-M2-3.', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefotaxime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('non-beta-lactam', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amino acid', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39270847,2025,"This case report explores the utility of monitoring automated rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test results in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from a patient undergoing treatment for neurosyphilis. Syphilis treatment is based on the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and syphilis treponema antibody levels, and in the case of RPR-positive syphilis, a 1/4 reduction in the RPR value by the manual card test is considered curative. However, it should be noted that when RPR is followed by the manual card test, there may seem to be no reduction when the automated method shows a steady reduction. In the present case, initially under surveillance for an unrelated condition, was found to have symptoms; imaging and serological findings suggestive of syphilis infection including syphilitic aortitis and neurosyphilis. After two weeks of high-dose intravenous Penicillin G, the patient was treated with oral amoxicillin as an indicator of RPR titers in both the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by automated latex agglutination. RPR in serum automated latex agglutination decreased to 1/4 at 14 weeks and treatment was terminated, with a subsequent downward trend. The RPR using the manual card test was 1/2 at 14 weeks. If only the manual card method was used, the patient might require a longer treatment. In conclusion, the automated latex agglutination method for monitoring the treatment response may be useful, especially in patients with high RPR titers.","[('neurosyphilis', 'DISEASE'), ('syphilis treponema', 'DISEASE'), ('syphilis', 'DISEASE'), ('syphilis infection', 'DISEASE'), ('syphilitic aortitis', 'DISEASE'), ('neurosyphilis', 'DISEASE'), ('high-dose', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39269186,2024,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging worldwide problem and a health threat for humans and animals. Antimicrobial usage in human and animal medicine or in agriculture results in selection for AMR. The selective concentration of antimicrobial compounds can be lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration and differs between environments, which can be a reason for bacterial resistance. Therefore, knowledge of the minimal selective concentration (MSC), under natural conditions, is essential to understand the selective window of bacteria when exposed to residual antimicrobials. In this study, we estimated the MSCs of three antimicrobials, amoxicillin, doxycycline, and enrofloxacin in a complex microbial community by conducting fermentation assays with cecal material derived from broilers. We examined the phenotypic resistance of Escherichia coli, resistome, and microbiome after 6 and 30 hours of fermenting in the presence of the antimicrobials of interest. The concentrations were estimated to be 10-100 times lower than the epidemiological cut-off values in E. coli for the respective antimicrobials as determined by EUCAST, resulting in an MSC between 0.08 and 0.8 mg/L for amoxicillin, 0.4 and 4 mg/L for doxycycline, and 0.0125 and 0.125 mg/L for enrofloxacin. Additionally, resistome analysis provided an MSC for doxycycline between 0.4 and 4 mg/L, but amoxicillin and enrofloxacin exposure did not induce a significant difference. Our findings indicate at which concentrations there is still selection for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. This knowledge can be used to manage the risk of the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.IMPORTANCEAntimicrobial resistance possibly affects human and animal health, as well as economic prosperity in the future. The rise of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is a consequence of using antimicrobial compounds in humans and animals selecting for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Concentrations reached during treatment are known to be selective for resistant bacteria. However, at which concentrations residues are still selective is important, especially for antimicrobial compounds that remain in the environment at low concentrations. The data in this paper might inform decisions regarding guidelines and regulations for the use of specific antimicrobials. In this study, we are providing these minimal selective concentrations for amoxicillin, doxycycline, and enrofloxacin in complex environments.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('enrofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('enrofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('enrofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('enrofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39268485,2024,"INTRODUCTION: The decreasing Helicobacter pylori eradication rate is primarily attributed to antibiotic resistance, and further exacerbated by uniform drug administration disregarding a host's metabolic capability. Consequently, applying personalized treatment based on antibiotic resistance-associated variants and the host's metabolic phenotype can potentially increase the eradication rate. METHOD: A custom next-generation sequencing panel for personalized H. pylori eradication treatment (NGS-PHET) was designed which targeted the regions for amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, and levofloxacin-resistance in H. pylori and human proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) metabolism. The libraries were constructed following customized methods and sequenced simultaneously. The customized framework criteria, grounded in previously reported antibiotic resistance associated variants and the host's PPI metabolism, was applied to the NGS-PHET results and suggested a personalized treatment for each subject, which was validated through each subject's actual eradication outcome. RESULTS: Both previously reported and novel variants were identified from H. pylori sequencing results. Concurrently, five CYP2C19 homozygous extensive metabolizers and three CYP3A4 intermediate metabolizers were identified. Among the total of 12 subjects, clarithromycin triple therapy was suggested for five subjects, bismuth quadruple therapy was suggested for six subjects, and rifabutin triple therapy was suggested for one subject by following the customized framework criteria. The treatment suggestion for nine of the 12 subjects was consistent with the treatment that each subject achieved eradication with. DISCUSSION: Applying the methodology using the NGS-PHET and customized framework helps to perform eradication treatment quickly and effectively in most patients with antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strains, and is also useful in research to find novel antibiotic-resistance candidates.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('proton-pump', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('bismuth', 'CHEMICAL'), ('rifabutin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39265849,2024,"In modern times, many antibiotics have become less effective as microorganisms develop resistance. Besides antibiotic resistance, another bacterial strategy that contributes to the capacity to withstand antimicrobials is biofilm formation. Because of these bacterial survival strategies, the desired response cannot be achieved with conventional treatment. Considering the limited discovery of new compounds, the most logical approach is to reconstruct existing antimicrobial molecules with nano-drug delivery systems. With this scientific approach, the aim of the study is to develop a novel nano-antibiotic hydrogel formulation containing silver nanoparticles, chitosan, and amoxicillin. Endodontic disease was used as a model of biofilm-mediated infection, and the antibacterial activity of nano-antibiotic hydrogel was evaluated with the E. faecalis standard bacterial strain. By adopting the Box-Behnken design for the optimisation of formulation variables, an innovative pharmaceutical formulation with antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity was successfully obtained. Further characterisation studies, including nanoparticle characterisation, in vitro cytotoxicity, and ex vivo activity studies, were carried out on dental samples using the optimised formulation. All results were compared with antimicrobial agents routinely used in endodontic treatment. The findings mainly conclude that the optimised nano-antibiotic hydrogel may be an alternative antimicrobial formulation since it is non-cytotoxic and exhibits high antibiofilm activity.","[('silver', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chitosan', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('biofilm-mediated infection', 'DISEASE'), ('non-cytotoxic', 'DISEASE')]"
39261762,2024,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major global public health issue. Infections caused by resistant species are associated with higher mortality rates, longer hospital stays, medication failure, and rising medical costs. The World Health Organisation has declared multidrug resistance-associated infections as an epidemic of public health concern. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance profile and associated factors of hospital-acquired Gram-negative bacterial pathogens among hospitalized patients in Northeast Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among hospitalized patients from March 2021 to February 2022. About 810 clinical specimens were collected, transported, and processed from admitted patients following the standard bacteriological procedures. The clinical samples were inoculated onto blood agar, MacConkey agar, and chocolate agar. Furthermore, the species identification was done using gram reactions, colony morphology, and color and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and carbapenemase production were performed as per the clinical laboratory standard institute guidelines. For analysis, the information was entered into Epi-data and exported to SPSS. A P value of < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval was considered as a statistically significant association. RESULTS: Out of 810 clinical specimens, 285/810 (35.2%) developed bacterial infections. From the isolated bacteria, E. coli was the predominant bacteria accounting for 78/285 (27.4%) followed by K. pneumoniae, 69/285(24.42%), whereas P. vulgaris accounted for the least, 7/285 (2.5%). Overall, 132/285 (46.3%) and 99/285 (34.7%) of culture-positive patients were infected by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing bacteria. The overall multidrug resistance rate of the isolated bacteria was 89.4%. The highest antibiotic resistance rates were detected for doxycycline (92.9%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (83.9%), and ampicillin (93%). The least antibiotic resistance rate was observed for meropenem at 41.1% and amikacin at 1.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: In the study area, significant health concerns include a range of hospital-acquired bacterial infections associated with elevated rates of multidrug resistance, Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), and carbapenemase-producing bacterial pathogens. Consequently, it is recommended to conduct drug-susceptibility testing of isolates and molecular detection at a national level to optimize antibiotic usage for treating prevalent bacterial infections in this area.","[('Infections', 'DISEASE'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE'), ('K. pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('P. vulgaris', 'DISEASE'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ampicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('meropenem', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amikacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('infections', 'DISEASE'), ('bacterial infections', 'DISEASE')]"
39257120,2024,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae (hmvKp), which complicates community-acquired pneumonia, has been increasing recently. This study aimed to detect hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae and determine its antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 39 K. pneumoniae isolates identified by using Gram stain, culture, and biochemical tests from 312 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Referral Hospital from April to June 2021. The hypermucoviscous strains were identified by using the string test. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by using the Kirby-Bauer disk dif-fusion method. Data were entered by using EPI data version 4.6 and were analyzed by using SPSS version 20. A p-value </= 0.05 at a 95% confidence interval was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall, 35.9% (n = 14) of the 39 K. pneumoniae isolates were hypermucoviscous phenotype. The mean age of the hmvKp group was lower than of the cKp group (36.93 +/- 12.573 vs. 53.52 +/- 19.556 years, p = 0.007). All hmvKp isolates were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Azithromycin resistance in the hmvKp strains was significantly higher than in the cKp group (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the hmvKp phenotype causes community-acquired pneumonia and a full resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Antimicrobial resistance was higher in the hmvKp strain than in the classic strains. Further detection of resistance genes, capsular serotypes, hypermucoviscosity-related genes, and virulence genes is necessary.","[('hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('community-acquired pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('community-acquired pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('community-acquired pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('K. pneumoniae', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Azithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('community-acquired pneumonia', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39257096,2024,"In comparison to the efforts required to bring a new drug or formulation to the clinic, bestowing a name on a medicine is relatively simple. However, if the name we choose causes confusion-by making its contents ambiguous or if it is too alike another drug-it can precipitate clinical errors. This prompted the World Health Organization to set up the International Nonproprietary Naming Committee in the 1970s to select unambiguous names for drugs. Unfortunately, multidrug products-which are becoming increasingly popular-do not fall under the remit of conventional International Non-proprietary Nomenclature. We have identified 26 combination formulations that have been historically named with the co-drug format in the United Kingdom. Most of them have also been prescribed in the United Kingdom in the past year, and although several of them are not prescribed very often, 11 were prescribed more than 2000 times. In this paper, we have explored the literature to identify prescribing errors with co-drug products and found several idiosyncrasies that have caused drug errors in the past. We advocate for a standard nomenclature (state the international nonproprietary name [INN] of each component followed by dose information in the x + y format) for these products on the box and in prescribing resources. We hope that this will enhance clarity and safety during prescribing and administration, particularly for high-volume drugs like paracetamol + codeine (co-codamol), amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) and trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole).","[('drug errors', 'DISEASE'), ('INN', 'CHEMICAL'), ('paracetamol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('codeine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-codamol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin + clavulanic acid', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-amoxiclav', 'CHEMICAL'), ('trimethoprim', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('co-trimoxazole', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39254054,2024,"INTRODUCTION: While 10% of pregnant individuals report a penicillin allergy, there is no established best practice for penicillin allergy delabeling in pregnancy. To better understand options for penicillin delabeling, we aimed to evaluate two penicillin allergy delabeling protocols in pregnancy regarding efficacy, adverse events, and patient satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From July 2019 to December 2022, we completed a two-center prospective cohort study, where each site recruited pregnant patients over 24 weeks gestational age with a reported penicillin allergy. One center offered antepartum amoxicillin oral challenges, either directly or after negative skin testing (i.e., antepartum oral challenge site). Our other centers completed a two-step approach with antepartum penicillin skin testing only and deferred oral challenges to the postpartum period (i.e., postpartum oral challenge site). Our primary outcome was the rate of penicillin allergy delabeling, defined as tolerating an antibiotic challenge with penicillin or amoxicillin. Univariate analyses were completed using chi-squared, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank tests. RESULTS: During the study period, 276 pregnant patients were assessed, with 207 in the antepartum oral challenge site and 69 in the postpartum oral challenge site. Among the 204 patients who completed antepartum oral challenges, 201 (98%) passed without reactions. Deferring oral challenges to the postpartum period led to a loss of follow-up for 37/53 (70%) of eligible individuals. Overall, 97% (201/207) of patients at the antepartum oral challenge site were delabeled from their penicillin allergy-compared to 38% (26/69) of patients referred to the postpartum oral challenge site (p < 0.0001). Three antepartum oral challenge reactions were noted, including two mild cutaneous reactions and a case of transient abdominal discomfort. CONCLUSIONS: Antepartum amoxicillin oral challenge is a more effective method to delabel pregnant patients from their penicillin allergy. Deferral of oral challenges to the postpartum period introduces a significant barrier for penicillin allergy delabeling.","[('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39253509,2024,"Achieving ultra-long-term release of hydrophilic drugs over several months remains a significant challenge for existing long-acting injectables (LAIs). Existing platforms, such as in situ forming implants (ISFI), exhibit high burst release due to solvent efflux and microsphere-based approaches lead to rapid drug diffusion due to significant water exchange and large pores. Addressing these challenges, we have developed an injectable platform that, for the first time, achieves ultra-long-term release of hydrophilic drugs for over six months. This system employs a methacrylated ultra-low molecular weight pre-polymer (polycaprolactone) to create in situ cross-linked depots (ISCD). The ISCD's solvent-free design and dense mesh network, both attributed to the ultra-low molecular weight of the pre-polymer, effectively minimizes burst release and water influx/efflux. In vivo studies in rats demonstrate that ISCD outperforms ISFI by achieving lower burst release and prolonged drug release. We demonstrated the versatility of ISCD by showcasing ultra-long-term delivery of several hydrophilic drugs, including antiretrovirals (tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, abacavir, and lamivudine), antibiotics (vancomycin and amoxicillin) and an opioid antagonist naltrexone. Additionally, ISCD achieved ultra-long-term release of the hydrophobic drug tacrolimus and enabled co-delivery of hydrophilic drug combinations encapsulated in a single depot. We also identified design parameters to tailor the polymer network, tuning drug release kinetics and ISCD degradation. Pharmacokinetic modeling predicted over six months of drug release in humans, significantly surpassing the one-month standard achievable for hydrophilic drugs with existing LAIs. The platform's biodegradability, retrievability, and biocompatibility further underscore its potential for improving treatment adherence in chronic conditions.","[('polycaprolactone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tenofovir', 'CHEMICAL'), ('emtricitabine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('abacavir', 'CHEMICAL'), ('lamivudine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('vancomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('naltrexone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hydrophobic', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tacrolimus', 'CHEMICAL')]"

39251950,2024,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infects the stomach and/or small intestines in more than half of the human population. Infection with H. pylori is the most common cause of chronic gastritis, which can lead to more severe gastroduodenal pathologies such as peptic ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer. H. pylori infection is particularly concerning in Colombia in South America, where > 80% of the population is estimated to be infected with H. pylori and the rate of stomach cancer is one of the highest in the continent. RESULTS: We compared the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and short-read genome sequences of five H. pylori isolates obtained from patients diagnosed with gastritis of varying severity (chronic gastritis, antral erosive gastritis, superficial gastritis) in Pereira, Colombia sampled in 2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed the isolates to be resistant to at least one of the five antimicrobials tested: four isolates were resistant to metronidazole, two to clarithromycin, two to levofloxacin, and one to rifampin. All isolates were susceptible to tetracycline and amoxicillin. Comparative genome analyses revealed the presence of genes associated with efflux pump, restriction modification systems, phages and insertion sequences, and virulence genes including the cytotoxin genes cagA and vacA. The five genomes represent three novel sequence types. In the context of the Colombian and global populations, the five H. pylori isolates from Pereira were phylogenetically distant to each other but were closely related to other lineages circulating in the country. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori from gastritis of different severity varied in their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and genome content. This knowledge will be useful in implementing appropriate eradication treatment regimens for specific types of gastritis. Understanding the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity in H. pylori across the geographical landscape is critical in informing health policies for effective disease prevention and management that is most effective at local and country-wide scales.

However, the risk of food contamination by antibiotic residues is one of the significant problems facing public health, and is a result of the irresponsible use of veterinary drugs. One hundred goat farmers were interviewed using a questionnaire, and raw milk samples from 266 goats were collected and analysed for the presence of antibiotic residues. Screening for amoxicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethazine, erythromycin, and streptomycin residues was done using the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) while high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out for confirmation. The questionnaire shows that all (100%) of the participants acknowledged the use of antibiotics on their goats and 99% of them were aware of the possibility of antibiotic residues in milk. ELISA results for residues of erythromycin, sulfamethazine and amoxicillin exceeded the Codex Alimentarius maximum residue levels (MRLs) in 94.7%, 82.3%, and 35.3% of analysed samples, respectively. Tetracycline was present in all (100%) analysed milk samples, and streptomycin was detected in 18.7% of samples; however, these results were below the recommended MRLs. The HPLC method confirmed the presence of streptomycin and tetracycline residues in 90% and 40% of the samples analysed. However, the concentrations were below the accepted MRL standards. Approximately 76.6% of samples exceeded the established MRL for sulfamethazine and 10% for erythromycin. Amoxicillin was not detected by the HPLC method. The results obtained in this study indicate a high level of contamination of goat milk with antibiotic residues, which may harm the health of the consumers.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfamethazine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('streptomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfamethazine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('streptomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('streptomycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfamethazine', 'CHEMICAL'), ('erythromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('Amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39248301,2025,"BACKGROUND: Combining antibiotics with non-surgical periodontal therapy has a beneficial impact in case of infection while its role for dental-related outcomes is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: The current study's main objective was to evaluate the impact of adding adjuvant systemic and topical antimicrobial therapy to non-surgical periodontal therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was accomplished and 1,093 study participants with periodontal diseases were recruited to the current study; 541 of them were treated with adjuvant systemic or topical antimicrobial agents and 552 with non-surgical interventions. The inclusion criteria of the current study took into account only randomized clinical trials. RESULTS: Adding systemic antibiotics to non-surgical intervention resulted in a significant enhancement regarding probing pocket depth reduction (PPD). Metronidazole/amoxicillin showed a significant impact on PPD and the clinical attachment level (CAL), while doxycycline showed no significant impact regarding CAL. Using topical antimicrobial agents showed a significant beneficial role in reducing PPD regarding doxycycline, while non-significant effects were seen with metronidazole. CONCLUSION: Adding adjuvant systemic and topical antimicrobial agents to non-surgical periodontal therapy showed a beneficial impact regarding PPD and CAL (metronidazole/amoxicillin and doxycycline). In addition, using doxycycline as a topical agent showed a beneficial impact on the reduction of PPD.","[('infection', 'DISEASE'), ('periodontal diseases', 'DISEASE'), ('Metronidazole/amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39248289,2024,"Laser scribing is a promising technology for the rapid and large-scale production of low-cost electrochemical sensors from diverse substrates. Polyimide has been the most popular so far because of its low cost, flexibility and capability of generating high-quality porous graphene films, known as laser-induced graphene (LIG). Herein we report the electrochemistry of chloramphenicol (CAP) on LIG electrodes and its determination in honey samples. LIG electrodes were fabricated by the photothermal conversion of sp(3) carbon within the polymeric matrix into sp(2) carbon using a CO(2) laser cutter. The LIG electrode associated with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) showed good linearity (R(2) > 0.99) in the range from 10 to 160 mumol L(-1) with a limit of detection of 1.0 mumol L(-1) and good precision (RSD < 5%) for the electrochemical reduction of CAP species. Detection was possible free from the interference of other antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, tetracycline, sulfanilamide, and sulfamethoxazole. Spiked honey samples were analyzed by the standard-addition method and recovery values between 86 and 109% were obtained, which confirmed the absence of sample matrix effects. Therefore, the proposed sensor is an alternative, feasible, low-cost, and powerful analytical tool for the determination of CAP in honey.","[('Polyimide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('LIG', 'CHEMICAL'), ('chloramphenicol', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CAP', 'CHEMICAL'), ('LIG', 'CHEMICAL'), ('LIG', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbon', 'CHEMICAL'), ('carbon', 'CHEMICAL'), ('LIG', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfanilamide', 'CHEMICAL'), ('sulfamethoxazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('CAP', 'CHEMICAL')]"
39245326,2024,"BACKGROUND: Empirical treatment needs to be supported by regional data, but knowledge of interregional differences is currently lacking in China. This study aimed to summarize and map the primary and secondary antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori in different regions of mainland China. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang databases were systematically reviewed for studies published between 1 January 2000 and 15 July 2023. Data related to primary and secondary H. pylori antibiotic resistance rates were included. Random-effects models were used to synthesize the pooled resistance rates. RESULTS: Ultimately, 74 studies were included in the final analysis. A total of 16 provinces reported resistance data. The overall resistance rates of H. pylori in mainland China were 30.72% (95% CI 27.53%-33.99%) to clarithromycin, 70.14% (95% CI 29.53%-37.46%) to metronidazole and 32.98% (95% CI 28.73%-37.37%) to levofloxacin; for amoxicillin, tetracycline, and furazolidone, the rates were 2.41% (95% CI 1.43%-3.60%), 2.53% (95% CI 1.19%-4.28%) and 1.54% (95% CI 0.28%-3.62%), respectively. Spatial and temporal differences were observed. The resistance rates increased after treatment failure; however, secondary resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline and furazolidone were still low across the vast majority of study regions. CONCLUSION: Surveillance of the updated prevalence of antibiotic resistance of H. pylori for different regions is warranted, which should factor into clinical decision making and guideline recommendations.","[('pylori', 'DISEASE'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('metronidazole', 'CHEMICAL'), ('levofloxacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('furazolidone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('tetracycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('furazolidone', 'CHEMICAL'), ('pylori', 'DISEASE')]"
39244723,2024,"BACKGROUND: We compared efficacy of vonoprazan-dual or triple therapies and bismuth-quadruple therapy for treatment-naive Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection in Southern China, where primary resistance rates of clarithromycin and levofloxacin are >30%. METHODS: This was an investigator-initiated, three-arm, randomized clinical trial in Southern China. Between March 2022 and August 2023, treatment-naive HP-infected adults were randomly assigned to receive one of three 14-day regimens (1:1:1 ratio): vonoprazan-dual (VA-dual; vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1 g thrice daily), vonoprazan-triple (VAC-triple; vonoprazan 20 mg/amoxicillin 1 g/clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily), or bismuth-quadruple therapy containing bismuth, esomeprazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole. Primary outcome was noninferiority in HP eradication, evaluated by UBT 4-6 weeks post-treatment by intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis (based on subjects who completed 14-day treatment and rechecked UBT). Bonferroni-adjusted p-value of <0.017 was used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 298 subjects (mean age: 35.7 +/- 8.4 years; male: 134 [45.0%]; VC-dual: 100, VAC-triple: 98, bismuth-quadruple: 100) were enrolled, and 292 (98.0%) had UBT rechecked. ITT analysis showed that both VA-dual (eradication rate of 96.0%) and VAC-triple therapies (95.9%) were noninferior to bismuth-quadruple therapy (92.0%) (difference: 4.0%, 95% CI: -2.9% to 11.5%, p < 0.001; and 3.9%, 95% CI: -3.1% to 11.5%, p < 0.001, respectively). PP analysis also revealed noninferiority (96.7% or 96.7% vs. 97.4%, with difference: -2.9% and -2.9%, p = 0.009 and 0.010, respectively). The frequency of adverse events was 39.0%, 56.1%, and 71.0% in VA-dual, VAC-triple, and bismuth-quadruple therapies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: VA-dual and VA-triple therapies are highly effective and noninferior to bismuth-quadruple therapy in Southern China. Given the lower adverse effects and fewer antibiotic use, VA-dual therapy is the preferred first-line treatment for HP infection.

39243910,2024,"Orally administered amoxicillin is recommended as the first-line treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABR) and given in a high-dose regimen. However, the risk of various systemic adverse reactions and low oral bioavailability are unbearable, increasing the threat of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, nasal delivery of amoxicillin can be a potential approach for effectively treating ABR locally, as well as overcoming those drawbacks. In a way to guarantee the effectiveness for local therapy in nasal cavity, the permeation and retention properties are of significant importance considerations. Accordingly, the present work aimed to investigate the characteristics with respect to the nasal applicability of the in situ gelling amoxicillin trihydrate (AMT) and further evaluate its permeability and retention properties through human nasal mucosa. The lyophilized formulations were characterized utilizing the Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), and also evaluated for its polarity, reconstitution time, droplet size distribution, mucoadhesive properties, and ex vivo permeability and retention studies. The results confirmed that the in situ gelling AMT formulations possess adequate mucoadhesive behavior, especially the formulation containing 0.3 % of gellan gum. Substantially, the in situ gelling AMT formulations were able to retain the drug on the surface of nasal mucosa instead of permeating across the membrane; thus, suitable for treating nasal infections locally. Altogether, the in situ gelling systems demonstrates promising abilities as a delivery platform to enhance local application of AMT within the nasal cavity.","[('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('high-dose', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin trihydrate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('nasal infections', 'DISEASE')]"
39243046,2024,"BACKGROUND: Millions of people die every year as a result of antimicrobial resistance worldwide. An inappropriate prescription of antimicrobials (e.g., overuse, inadequate use, or a choice that diverges from established guidelines) can lead to a heightened risk of antimicrobial resistance. This study aimed to determine the rate and appropriateness of antimicrobial prescriptions for respiratory tract infections. METHODS: This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest Health and Medicine, and Scopus were searched between October 1, 2023, and December 15, 2023, with no time constraints. Studies were independently screened by the first author and the co-authors. We included original studies reporting antimicrobial prescription patterns and appropriateness for respiratory tract infections. The quality of included studies' was assessed via the Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Checklists for Cross-Sectional Studies. The assessment of publication bias was conducted using a funnel plot and Egger's regression test. A random effect model was employed to estimate the pooled antibiotic prescribing and inappropriate rates. Subgroup analysis was conducted by country, study period, data source, and age group. RESULTS: Of the total 1220 identified studies, 36 studies were included in the review. The antimicrobial prescribing rate ranged from 25% (95% CI 0.24-0.26) to 90% (95% CI 0.89-0.91). The pooled antimicrobial prescription rate was 66% (95% CI 0.57 to 0.73). Subgroup analysis by region revealed that the antimicrobial prescription rate was highest in Africa (79%, 95% CI 0.48-0.94) and lowest in Europe (47%, 95% CI 0.32-0.62). Amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate antimicrobials from the Access group, along with azithromycin and erythromycin from the Watch group, were the most frequently used antimicrobial agents. This study revealed that the major reasons for antimicrobial prescription were acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and the common cold. The pooled inappropriate antimicrobial prescription rate was 45% (95% CI 0.38-0.52). Twenty-eight of the included studies reported that prescribing antimicrobials without proper indications was the main cause of inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions. Additionally, subgroup analysis by region showed a higher inappropriate antimicrobial prescription rate in Asia at 49% (95% CI 0.38-0.60). The result of the funnel plot and Egger's tests revealed no substantial publication bias (Egger's test: p = 0.268). CONCLUSION: The prescribing rate and inappropriate use of antimicrobials remain high and vary among countries. Further studies should be conducted to generate information about factors contributing to unnecessary antimicrobial prescriptions in outpatients.

39241913,2024,"Febrile neutropenia is a common complication of conditioning chemotherapy for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), but a major barrier for optimal treatment of febrile neutropenia is historical penicillin allergies. Our group recently published a development of a clinical pipeline for delabeling penicillin allergies in adult patients planned to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In this retrospective cohort study, we followed patients to evaluate their outcomes during inpatient admission for HSCT. We hypothesized that, among patients planned for HSCT with a self-reported penicillin allergy, completing penicillin allergy testing (amoxicillin ingestion challenge with or without concomitant penicillin skin testing) prior to HSCT admission would be associated with differences in inpatient treatment for febrile neutropenia (including antibiotic selection and timing of antibiotic administration) and improved inpatient resource utilization (including nursing and inpatient physician consults). We identified patients with a self-reported penicillin allergy who answered a penicillin allergy questionnaire and were subsequently admitted to our institution for HSCT. We divided the cohort into 2 groups: patients whose penicillin allergy was evaluated prior to admission (EPTA) and patients whose penicillin allergy was not evaluated prior to admission (NEPTA). We then performed comparison between the 2 groups for general clinical outcomes of HSCT admission (duration of admission, need for ICU transfer, readmission rate, etc.), febrile neutropenia treatment, and inpatient resource utilization. Statistics were calculated using the nonparametric 2-tailed Fisher exact test for categorical outcomes and the nonparametric 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test for numerical outcomes. Within our cohort, 35 patients completed penicillin allergy testing prior to HSCT admission (EPTA) and 44 patients did not (NEPTA). Demographics were similar between these groups, and there was no significant difference in the rate of febrile neutropenia during HSCT admission (EPTA 64% versus NEPTA 66%, P = 1.00). EPTA patients were significantly more likely to receive standard first-line antibiotics (cefepime or ceftazidime) for febrile neutropenia (EPTA 95% versus NEPTA 65%, P = .015) and time between febrile neutropenia onset and antibiotic administration was shorter (EPTA mean 66 mins versus NEPTA mean 121 mins, P = .0058). No patients in the EPTA group experienced an immediate hypersensitivity reaction (hives, anaphylaxis, etc.) or severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) during HSCT admission. EPTA patients were also significantly less likely to require 1:1 nursing for antibiotic test doses, challenges, and desensitizations (EPTA 0% versus NEPTA 49%, P < .0001); less likely to require inpatient allergy consult (EPTA 0% versus NEPTA 12%, P = .031); and less likely to require inpatient antimicrobial stewardship consult (EPTA 0% versus NEPTA 13%, P = .013) during their HSCT admission. In summary, patients who completed penicillin allergy testing prior to HSCT admission were more likely to receive first-line antibiotics and received antibiotics more rapidly for treatment of febrile neutropenia. Furthermore, patients who completed penicillin allergy testing prior to HSCT admission were less likely to require 1:1 nursing, inpatient allergy consults, and inpatient antimicrobial stewardship consults during HSCT admission.","[('Febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergies', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amoxicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('EPTA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefepime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('ceftazidime', 'CHEMICAL'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('EPTA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('hypersensitivity', 'DISEASE'), ('anaphylaxis', 'DISEASE'), ('cutaneous adverse reaction', 'DISEASE'), ('EPTA', 'CHEMICAL'), ('allergy', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('febrile neutropenia', 'DISEASE'), ('penicillin allergy', 'CHEMICAL'), ('allergy', 'DISEASE')]"
39240777,2024,"Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MAbc) is a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium that represents an increasingly prevalent cause of skin infections. This report describes an atypical presentation of MAbc to heighten physician awareness of the pathogen. A 69-year-old woman with immunocompromised status presented with a 4-month history of a solitary, nonhealing ulcer on her right lower extremity after an insect bite. After no improvement following oral amoxicillin/clavulanate and topical mupirocin for the initial diagnosis of cellulitis, biopsy and culture of the lesion revealed MAbc. Microscopic examination revealed reactive cutaneous inflammation without evidence of malignancy. Acid-fast bacteria (AFB) stain was negative, and no granulomas were noted histologically. Clarithromycin and doxycycline were initiated while awaiting susceptibility testing results. Final culture showed MAbc sensitive to amikacin, cefoxitin, and clarithromycin. Unfortunately, before antibiotic therapy could be modified, the patient died. The presentation of a solitary lower-extremity ulcer is rare compared with current literature. This case occurred after a suspected insect bite rather than instrumentation. In addition, this case demonstrated negative AFB stain and absence of granulomas on histologic analysis. The patient's death did not allow for evaluation of treatment efficacy. Existing literature characterizing MAbc is sparse. Most cases present as multiple papules, nodules, and abscesses with positive AFB staining and granulomas; it is possible for deviations to exist depending on host immune status. Considering the highly drug-resistant nature of M abscessus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. For this to occur, clinicians must maintain high clinical suspicion for M abscessus infection in any chronic, nonhealing wound failing to respond to initial treatment.","[('nontuberculous mycobacterium', 'DISEASE'), ('skin infections', 'DISEASE'), ('nonhealing ulcer', 'DISEASE'), ('amoxicillin/clavulanate', 'CHEMICAL'), ('mupirocin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cellulitis', 'DISEASE'), ('inflammation', 'DISEASE'), ('malignancy', 'DISEASE'), ('granulomas', 'DISEASE'), ('Clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('doxycycline', 'CHEMICAL'), ('amikacin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('cefoxitin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('clarithromycin', 'CHEMICAL'), ('solitary lower-extremity ulcer', 'DISEASE'), ('granulomas', 'DISEASE'), ('death', 'DISEASE'), ('granulomas', 'DISEASE'), ('abscessus', 'DISEASE'), ('abscessus infection', 'DISEASE'), ('nonhealing', 'DISEASE')]"
