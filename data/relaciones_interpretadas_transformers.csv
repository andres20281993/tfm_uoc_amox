EPTA,allergy,comparación,"EPTA patients were also significantly less likely to require 1:1 nursing for antibiotic test doses, challenges, and desensitizations (EPTA 0% versus NEPTA 49%, P < .0001); less likely to require inpatient allergy consult (EPTA 0% versus NEPTA 12%, P = .031); and less likely to require inpatient antimicrobial stewardship consult (EPTA 0% versus NEPTA 13%, P = .013) during their HSCT admission.","EPTA is mentioned in comparative context with allergy, possibly in terms of efficacy or safety: ""EPTA patients were also significantly less likely to require 1:1 nursing for antibiotic test doses, challenges, and desensitizations (EPTA 0% versus NEPTA 49%, P < .0001); less likely to require inpatient allergy consult (EPTA 0% versus NEPTA 12%, P = .031); and less likely to require inpatient antimicrobial stewardship consult (EPTA 0% versus NEPTA 13%, P = .013) during their HSCT admission.""."
